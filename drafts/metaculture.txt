title: Putting "Meta" In Front of Words Makes Them Sound Cool, Right?
---

One of these days I'm going to write something about how some people, myself
included, get emotionally attached to, or emotionally repelled by, certain
charged words.  Think terms like "euthanasia" or "rape" or "life" or "free
will" or "consciousness".  People have a certain idea of what a word is
supposed to mean and won't let go.

For the moment, though, I'd like to focus on one word that I think falls
into this category: "multiculturalism".  Like everything else it means
different things to different people, but *some* people are emotionally
invested in the notion that it's a synonym for "cultural relativism".

I don't know the exact, academic definition of "cultural relativism".  The
everyday one off which I tend to base my opinions is that it's a version of
"ethical relativism".  It's the idea that you can't really rank cultures or,
perhaps more importantly, cultural *practices*, from "good" ones to "bad"
ones.  Or, to put it more bluntly, it's the idea that one cannot label
female circumcision, or child marriage, or sati as evil because, well,
that's just how they do things over there and who are we to judge?

Not to keep anyone in suspense, I'll say flat out: if *that's* your
definition of multiculturalism, then I'm not an advocate - but, then again,
I don't know anyone who is.  

I know lots of people who *identify* as multicultural, of course, 

I do, of course, know many people who self-identify as

Try *telling* that to some people, though, and you run afoul of people's
tendencies to get emotionally attached to words.

Like most rational people, I'm unwilling to judge an entire culture by the
presence of a few bad apples but, more than that, I'm unwilling to judge an
entire culture by the presence of a few bad *practices*.  Cultures are not
monolithic; you're allowed, at least in Canada, to pick out the good bits
and reject the rest.  This isn't ethical or cultural relativism in the sense
that I understand it - I'm very willing to label certain cultural practices
(sati, etc.), and the people who observe them, as unambiguously evil.

Female circumcision is evil.  Praying five times a day facing Mecca is not.
Accepting one does not mean accepting the other.  Cultures are not package
deals.
