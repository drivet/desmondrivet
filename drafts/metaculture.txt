title: Putting "Meta" In Front of Words Makes Them Sound Cool, Right?
---

Once again the niqab is in the news.  The issue may have cost Mulcair the
election.

One of these days I'm going to write about how some people, myself included,
are emotionally attached to, or emotionally repelled by, certain charged
words.  Think words like *euthanasia* or *rape* or *life" or
*consciousness*.

For the momement, though, I'm focussing on one word that I think falls into
this category: *multiculturalism*.  There are some people for whom the word
is simply another way fo saying "cultural relativsm".

It means different things to different
people.  Some people are emotionally invested in the idea that it's a
synonym for "cultural relativism" - which is, itself, another one of those
loaded terms.

I don't know the exact, academic definition of "cultural relativism".  The
colloquial one off which I tend to work is that it's a version of "ethical
relativism".  It's the idea that you can't really rank cultures or, perhaps
more importantly, cultural practices, from good to bad.

Or, to put it more bluntly: according to this view, you can't say that
female circumsicion, or child marriage, or sati is evil because, well,
that's just how they do things over there and who are you to judge?

Not to keep anyone in suspense, I'll say flat out: if *that's* your
definition of multiculturalism, then I'm not a multiculturalist.  I can,
however, say with certainty that this is not everyone's definiton of
multiculturalism.

Try *telling* that to some people, though, and you run afoul of people's
tendencies to get emotionally attached to words.
