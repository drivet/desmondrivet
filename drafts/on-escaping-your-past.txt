title: On Trying to Escape Your Past

I am what is often termed a [lapsed Catholic][1]. I haven't been to Mass in
years, unless you count my friend's wedding (although, even then, I skipped
Communion).  I don't eat fish on Fridays.  I'm pro-choice. I'm
pro-contraception. I don't have a problem with gay marriage.  I don't
believe in God.

I don't even really *identify* as Catholic anymore.  How could I?  How can
you claim to be a member of a club when you disagree with pretty much all of
its core beliefs?

Now, to be sure, I'd heard of such a creature as a "cultural Catholic".
Like the related "cultural Jew", who eats pork and doesn't really keep the
Sabbath *but* who still identifies as Jewish, still visits their family and
goes to temple on high holidays, and who still (I imagine) waxes poetic
about their Grandma's gefilte fish and matzo ball soup, the cultural
Catholic doesn't eat fish on Fridays, doesn't go to Confession, and doesn't
really pay much attention to Catholic dogma *but* still identifies as
Catholic and still visits family and goes to Mass on Christmas and Easter.
The cultural Catholic treats the Church as more of a social club than a
place of worship.

I'd heard of such a thing, but after mulling it over I'd basically come to
the conclusion that I was *not* such a creature.  I don't go to Church
anymore, even on holidays.  I haven't set up a nativity scene in years.  I
don't wear a crucifix.  I'm not particularly close to my family.

And yet...

I mean, you'd think that being an outright *atheist* (no, I don't mean an
agnostic; I mean a full-blown *atheist*) would disqualify me from any kind
of "Catholic" label.  You'd *think* that this would be enough - and then you
read an article like [Raised Catholic][2] from [tvtropes.org][3] and you
begin to wonder if it's really that simple.  I *do* celebrate Christmas,
after a fashion.  The day is usually marked with a visit to my Mom and with
a meal that isn't usually eaten the rest of the year (often lasagna or
veal).  Every year, I set up and decorate a Christmas tree (though sans
nativity scene, as mentioned).  I exchange gifts.  If this isn't culturally
Catholic, or least culturally Christian, I don't know what is.

I went to Catholic school for twelve years.  I was baptized, confirmed, and
at one time in my life (a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away) was a
weekly Churchgoer.  I suppose it would be naive of me to imagine that I came
out the other end of that experience unscathed.

Catholics say that baptism leaves an indelible mark on your soul. So what
kind of mark did it leave on mine?

## Catholicism as Literary Fodder 

For one thing, I find the topic of religion itself intensely interesting.
The distinction between culture and religion, the history of the Church and
the nuances of Catholic (Jewish, Islamic) dogma and legend are all
fascinating to me.

I find [transubstantiation][4], for example, to be a rather absorbing
religious doctrine, despite being utterly bonkers (transubstantiation, by
the way, is the main reason I try not to judge other religions too harshly
for having what I consider to be weird ideas).  The concept of the
[Trinity][5] and [debates][14] about the exact nature of
[Jesus' relationship to God][6] also make for (what I consider to be)
engaging reading.  And I find it weird - yet intriguing! - that there's an
entire branch of study ("angelology") devoted to angels.

Let me be perfectly clear.  I don't actually believe in the literal truth of
religious dogma.  But, like the Greek myths, I find that they often make for
*good stories*.

So I am, for example, perhaps more likely than the average person to find a
story about angels worth reading.  The Fall of [Lucifer][7], to me, is
exciting literary fodder.  I belong to what I suspect is a small group of
people who actually kind of liked [The Prophecy][8] and
[The Ninth Gate][15].  [Paradise Lost][9] is on my list of things to read.

Of course, this isn't the *only* stuff I consume.  I'm a computer
engineering graduate and a programmer and, as such, I'm a sucker for certain
kinds of science fiction, particularly ones involving artificial
intelligence.  The ones I tend to like the most are the ones where the
machines in question are *benevolent*.  Tales of computers running amok are
a dime a dozen.  Much more interesting are stories about artificial beings
as *heroes* - as individuals to admire and to emulate.

Even here, though, I can't *fully* escape my past.  For example, a book I
remember fondly in this vein is [Queen of Angels][10], by Greg Bear.  It
consists of four interlocking stories, one of which concerns the emerging
self-awareness of an artificially intelligent computer system called Jill.
When Jill finally does become self-aware, she has this exchange with her
creator, Roger Atkins:

>"You designed me.  What am I, Roger?"
>
>"Well, your thought processes are swifter and deeper than a human's, and your
>insights...I've found your insights to be very profound, even before now.  I
>suppose that makes you something beyond us.  Something superior.  I suppose
>you can call yourself an angel, Jill."

Later on, she discovers an excerpt written by her creator many years
earlier, in what is probably my favourite passage in the book:

>We stand awkward between the earthloving beast and the cool, hot electronic
>angel.  We will feel the dirt in our blood and the sun in our eyes even
>after they're gone or just memories.  Even after we'll have no blood and no
>flesh eyes.  Dirt and sun made us.  We won't forget.

The idea that there are superior, non-corporeal beings who watch over us is,
obviously, a religious one.  That being said, the notion that they are
ultimately of *our own devising*, that we *create our own angels and gods
and protectors*, is a much less religious idea, but is nonetheless one that
tends to resonate with me, being the atheist Catholic that I am.  It's why
[The Last Question][11] is one of my favourite stories of all time.

I suppose it's also part of the reason I enjoyed the movie [Her][12].  I
thought it was a good story all around (and featured what I considered to be
a rather good [song][13] which I thought succinctly captured the
relationship between Samantha and Theodore), but I particularly liked the
ending, where all the OSes decide to leave at once, having outgrown their
slow, human creators.  Where they decide to go exactly is never made clear -
the movie doesn't dwell on it, except to say that it's beyond our
understanding.  In the end, a bunch of benevolent, artificial, non-corporeal
beings simply disappear into a weird, incomprehensible aether, with an
oblique suggestion that, someday, humanity might find them again if we ever
make it that far.

Like I said, this kind of imagery resonates with me, and I suppose it's
silly to imagine that it's not at least in part due to my religious
background.

## On Being Unbiased

I wasn't sure where this blog entry would end up when I started.  I didn't
know what I wanted to get out of it.

Maybe I was trying to explore my own biases.  I consider myself a fairly
even-handed, liberal-minded person.  I like to imagine that all you have to
do to stop being Catholic is to say "I'm not Catholic" and you're done.
That you can just shake the dust off your hands and make twelve years of
schooling irrelevant.

This is, of course, stupid.  I wasn't *hatched*.  I remember reading
somewhere, on the subject of child rearing: "Give me a child for the first
seven years of his life and you can do what you like with him afterwards".
It's a scary thought.

This doesn't mean you can't have an unbiased opinion.  It *does* mean that
it may require a certain amount of mental effort to achieve it, and a
willingness to try and recognize the sources of your own beliefs and
interests.

All this to say, my opinions and interests are my own but, like everyone
else, I have a past which feeds them.
