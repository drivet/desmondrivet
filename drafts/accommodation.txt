title: On Being "Accommodating"
---

I really dislike the term "religious accommodation".  

It evokes entirely the wrong imagery.  When someone is "being accommodating"
they are doing something *active*, something they normally wouldn't do.
When one says that we're being "accommodating" by allowing a woman to wear
the niqab, one is talking as if the act of "allowing something" involves
*going out of our way*.  This is stupid.  You are not being *inconvenienced*
when a woman chooses to wear a niqab, any more than you are being
inconvenienced when she chooses to wear high heels.  Your rights are not
being violated.  No one is forcing *you* to wear high heels, and no one is
forcing *you* to wear a niqab.  The only onus on you is to leave her alone.
Refraining from *assaulting* someone (verbally or otherwise) is not the same
as "religious accommodation".  It's called "not engaging in criminal
behaviour".

In fact, I'm even uncomfortable with notion of "allowing" a woman to wear a
niqab - as if she needed our permission.

When Canada upholds the right of a woman to wear the niqab in public, or at
citizenship ceremonies, it is *not* being accommodating.

Real accommodation would be something like refusing to eat bacon in the
presence of orthodox Jews or Muslims.  As far as I know, no Jew or Muslim
has ever asked that of anyone in Canada.

No one has the right to have their cultural norms encased in ice.
