Title: The Difference between Murder and Suicide

I once got into a relatively lively email debate with a friend of mine
concerning the nature of free will. One of us argued that we had it and the
other argued that we didn't. The exchange ended when he sent me an email
explaining that he was agitated and losing sleep over the matter.

My life is weird sometimes.

People hear that story and often assume that my friend was the one who
believed in free will and that I was one who didn't but in reality the
reverse was true.  I believed in free will; my friend did not.

To this day I'm not 100% sure why he got so agitated but I suspect he
thought I was spouting some sort of mystical, new age nonsense and that this
(rightly) irritated him.  If I'm right, that's unfortunate, because that's
about as far away from my views as you can get.

To be clear, I don't actually believe in or practice mysticism of any
kind. But I do believe in free will. In retrospect, I can see how this
stance might be confusing. At least one of my friends has called it
"strange". I think it all harkens back to the way the free will debate is
peddled to the general populace (when people think about it at all).

# Traditional Dichotomies

The free will debate is conventionally framed as a contest between free will
and determinism. Traditionally, these concepts are understood to be mutually
exclusive - if you believe in one, you can't believe in the other. Believing
in determinism means believing that we live in a kind of "clockwork"
universe, where one physical event causes another physical event in an
endless chain going back to the beginning of time. All possible events in
the universe are subject to this causal chain.  In particular, since
*people* are generally considered to be part of the physical universe, and
since their brains are generally considered to be physical objects, and
since their choices are generally considered to be physical events, it can
be said that a person's "choices" are subject to this causal chain like any
other physical event. A person making a choice, in this kind of universe, is
not really fundamentally different than the operation of any physical system
- like a steam engine, for example.  A really, really *complicated* steam
engine.

People have a hard time imagining what a person's "free will" (as generally
understood) would even *look like* under such a framework. Where exactly
would it fit among all the swirling particles bumping up against each other
in pre-determined ways? The reason why it's so hard to imagine has to do
with a concept that's normally built into the popular account of free will:
the principle of ["alternative possibilities"][1]. The basic idea here is
simple and intuitive: if a person makes a free choice, let's say choosing
Snickers over Twix, *it must have been possible for her to choose Twix*.
That is to say, if one were to "rewind the universe" to the point just
before the choice was made, and watch the whole thing play out again, it
would still be possible for the person in question to choose Twix over
Snickers. You could do the same thing over and over again, and you wouldn't
be able to reliably predict the outcome.

This particular version of "alternative possibilities" (also known as the
"could have done otherwise" principle) is *completely* at odds with
determinism, which is why many people think that if you want to believe in
free will, you have to reject determinism, which effectively means rejecting
*science* - or at least rejecting the notion that the universe consists
*solely* of swirling particles bouncing off against each other like so many
billard balls (I'm grossly simplifying classical physics for the sake of
argument, but you get the idea). Believing in free will, under this
dichotomy, means believing that human beings somehow have the ability to
step outside the laws of physics when they make a choice. As it is virtually
impossible to describe how such an act is even conceivable, this belief
tends to be equated with a belief in miracles, or mysticism, or some new age
gobbledegook. In other words, it's not to be taken seriously by rationally
minded people.

# A Detour Into Quantum Physics

Of course, people with a certain amount of scientific knowledge understand
that the universe doesn't actually work this way - that the popular image of
the universe as a giant collection of billiard balls hitting each other in
mathematically calculatable ways is patently false. The relevant theory here
is *quantum mechanics*, and it has pretty much shown determinism the
door. Without going into the details (partly because they are not necessary,
but mostly because I don't know them), most interpretations state that
movement of particles in the universe is, to a large extent, completely
random. In this case, "rewinding the universe" really might lead to a
different outcome.

For a while, people thought that quantum mechanics could breathe new life
into the traditional notion of free will but as the years went on it became
clear that there was no easy way to make it work. For one thing, just
because the universe operates in a fundamentally random manner, it doesn't
follow that our brains operate in a similar way. Steam engines, with all
their classical, mathematical predictabilty, didn't suddenly stop working
when quantum mechanics was discovered even though their operation, like
everything else in the universe, is fundamentally based on quantum
mechanical theory. At a high enough level the universe becomes deterministic
and predictable; the question is whether our brains operate at a high enough
level for this to happen.

The problem, though, is more fundamental than that. Even if it were
discovered that quantum mechanical randomness formed an essential,
observable part of the every day operation of our brains, saying that one's
"choices" are the results of "random fluctuations" hardly seems any better
than saying that they are the result of a series of determined causes. If
it's hard to imagine where free will fits among the pre-determined
trajectories of swirling particles, it's equally hard to imagine where free
will fits among the *completely random* trajectories of swirling particles.

And so we're back to square one. The universe may or may not be
deterministic, our brains may or may be deterministic, but it seems that no
matter how this cake is sliced, there is no room for free will to operate in
this universe unless you reject the science.

# Rejecting the Dichotomy

And I mentioned before, I believe this last part is why my friend became
irritated with me. Given my support for the idea of free will, he thought I
was suggesting that human beings were in some way "magic", that I was in
some way rejecting the notion that humans beings were physical entities,
subject to physical laws. I wasn't, but it's an understandable mistake. The
way the debate is generally portrayed, there really isn't any other way to
think about it.

That is, of course, untrue; there are *many* different ways to think about
it. The first step is to realize that the free will debate, as it is
traditionally formulated, is founded on a [false dichotomy][2].
