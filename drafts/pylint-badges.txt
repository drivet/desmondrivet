title: Generating Pylint Badges
---

Badges, on Github and other code sharing sites, are a way to communicate
small snippets of information concerning the status of your repository.
They generally appear on your README file, so they are one of the first
things you see when you load a repository page.

On my [yawt][1] Github page, for example, you can see several badges for
things like my [travis][2] build status, and my GPA at [code climate][3].

One badge that I *couldn't* find, however, was a [pylint][4] badge - a
simple status that displayed your pylint score on 10.  This surprised me; it
seemed like such an obvious thing to want to do.  Indeed, I'm still not 100%
that I haven't simply overlooked something glaringly obvious.

But, alas, for whatever reason, I couldn't find one, and I haven't seen any
on the various python projects I'm come across.  So I decided to make one.
It turns out that it's really not that hard.
