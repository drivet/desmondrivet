I use Emacs as a python IDE.  The Web already offers a significant number of
resources concerning this subject but I've made a couple of specialized
tweaks that I feel may be worth sharing.  So here we are.

## What Was I Looking For?

I am mainly a Java and Eclipse user at work.  Eclipse makes Java programming
somewhat tolerable.  I tend to use the following features:

 * automatic import management
 * jump to definition
 * auto completion
 * refactoring tools, like method and variable renaming

A python IDE, for me, would have to have roughly the same feature set,
insofar as the dynamic nature of the language makes it possible.  It turns
out that this is possible in Emacs, with a little bit of elbow grease.

## Installing Rope

The first thing to do is to install [Rope][1], a python refactoring library.
This library isn't Emacs specific, so the second thing to do is to integrate
it with Emacs, via a library called [ropemacs][2].
