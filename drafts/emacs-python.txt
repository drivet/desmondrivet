title: Emacs and Python
tags: emacs,python

I use Emacs as a python IDE.  The Web already offers a significant number of
resources concerning this subject but I've made a couple of specialized
tweaks that I feel may be worth sharing.  So here we are.

## What Was I Looking For?

I am mainly a Java and Eclipse user at work.  Eclipse makes Java programming
somewhat tolerable.  I tend to use the following features:

 * automatic import management
 * jump to definition
 * auto completion
 * refactoring tools, like method and variable renaming

A python IDE, for me, would have to have roughly the same feature set,
insofar as the dynamic nature of the language makes it possible.  It turns
out that this is possible in Emacs, with a little bit of elbow grease.
These instructions focus on Emacs 24.

## Installing Rope

The first thing to do is to install [Rope][1], a python refactoring library
and, since it isn't Emacs specific, the second thing to do is to integrate
it with Emacs via a package called [ropemacs][2].  According to the github
page, Ropemacs is an "emacs mode that uses rope library to provide features
like python refactorings and code-assists".  Both packages are written in
python and can be installed via pip.

Though these libraries are usually available via the package management
system of your favourite Linux distribution, and though I'm normally an
advocate of using a Linux distribution's packaging system wherever possible,
the versions on PyPI are much more up-to-date are much more likely to work.
Plus, using pip makes it easier to use [virtualenv][4], if that's your thing
(which it should be, unless you're using [docker][5], which is on my list of
things to try out.

"But wait!", I hear you cry.  "Ropemacs is an emacs mode, and it's written
in *python*?  What sorcery is this?".  No sorcery, as it turns out; Ropemacs
works via another package called Pymacs, which provides an interface between
Emacs and python, allowing one to write emacs extensions in said language.

Anyway, like I said, rope and ropemacs are easy to install via pip:

    :::bash
    pip install rope ropemacs

Pymacs has two pieces to it: an emacs lisp piece and a python piece.  The
lisp piece is easy to install if you have ELPA set up.  I have this in my
init.el file:

    ::lisp
    (when (>= emacs-major-version 24)
        (require 'package)
        (package-initialize)
        (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("elpa" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/"))
           (add-to-list 'package-archives 
               '("marmalade" .  "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
           (add-to-list 'package-archives 
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t))

Run `M-x list-packages` and you'll get a buffer with a bunch of packages to
choose from.  Find the pymacs package, press 'i' and then 'x' to execute.
In short order you should have the package installed.

The python part of Pymacs is *surprisingly* difficult to install, mostly
because of its archaic build system.  I ended up installing it globally (So
I wouldn't have to do this for every virtualenv) as follows:

    ::bash
    pip install -e "git+https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs.git#egg=Pymacs"
    cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/pymacs
    make
    cp /root/src/pymacs/Pymacs.py /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

Replace the `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` part by whatever your
equivalent is.

## Using virtualenvs in Emacs

Most of my python projects are tucked away inside virtualenvs.  Using a
virtualenv means I can pip install any python package I want without
worrying about whether it's polluting my other projects.

Using virtualenvs complicates the whole emacs setup, but there are ways to
mitigate the problems that crop up.  My solution of choice is to use
[virtualenvwrapper.el][6], which lets you switch between virtualenvs from
within emacs.  The package handles a number of things for you; for example,
it will prepend the virtualenv's bin directory to the PATH environment
variable so you can run any executables local to the virtualenv.
