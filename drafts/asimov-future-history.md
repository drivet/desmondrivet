I read Issac Asimov's Foundation series in high school.  I was looking for
something to read, the trilogy was bound as one volume in my school library,
and I decided to give it a shot, pretty much without knowing anything about
it.

This was over 20 years ago.  My memories of it are hazy but I have a vague
recolection of actually liking it - at least enough to read continue with
the fourth and fifth novels.
