Title: How Islamic is Islamic State? I Don't Care

I saw this headline today:

["Mehdi Hasan: How Islamic is Islamic State?"][1]

And I just started gibbering a little.  I haven't read the full article.  I
don't really care about the answer.  It's a stupid question.

I have the same reaction to people who, when confronted with the reality of
women who are forced to wear the hijab, note that it's a cultural rather
than religious practice.  As if this distinction is somehow relavent.

What if ISIS really were following Koran to the letter?  Would that somehow
mean that the beheadings are acceptable?  And what if ISIS were NOT
following Koran to the letter?  Would that somehow make them fair targets?
More importantly, why *on earth* should the contents of the Koran matter in
this assessment?

The Bible has alot of crazy things to say.  For example, it prescribes, in
no uncertain terms, the stoning of homosexuals.  With that in mind, consider
the following exchange:

"I feel like killing some gays."

"That's wrong."

"No, it's not.  The Bible says I can do it right here."

"Oh, well, okay then, I'm convinced!"

This is a conversation you *won't* hear among normal, rational Christians,
Jews, Muslims, Hindus, what have you.

I imagine that this conversation *does* in fact play out more or less as
described above in some of the more fringy versions of Christianity.  The
fact that they are technically just following the dicates of the Bible
*doesn't make them any less crazy*.  It would be pointless to ask "How
Christian is Westboro Church"?  Because the answer, basically, is: "Very
Christian - and not Christian at all.  It depends on who you talk to.  And,
ultimately, it doesn't matter because they're FUCKING ASSHOLES, Bible or
not".

The people in ISIS are assholes.  It doesn't matter how "Muslim" they are,
however you chose to define the term.
