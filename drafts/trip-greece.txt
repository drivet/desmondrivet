Evelyn and I decided, on a whim, to travel to Greece this year. We went for
ten days.

This is the first time we've ever been overseas without knowing anyone at
the other end.  The one time we were in Europe together, in Lyon, we stayed
at a friend's apartment.

Our itinerary consisted of Athens, followed by Santorini, Rhodes, Delphi and
then Athens again.  This is quite a bit of moving about and I feel like we
saw a lot while simultaneously seeing very little.  Greece is the kind of
country where you can spit and hit a 2000 year old ruin.  This is only a
slight exaggeration.  We are, after all, talking about the cradle of Western
civilization.  You can't hope to see even a fraction of all there is to see
in only 10 days.

## Athens

We landed in Athens, and stayed at a centrally located Airbnb. 

First impressions of Athens: very noisy, very crowded, very dirty, and very
grafittied.  In other words, I am unimpressed.

My opinion changes somewhat as I make the climb to the Acropolis.  There is
something surreal about this...fort? temple?...sitting proud and high on its
hill, keeping watch over the city.

The whole experience needs time to marinate a bit before I can appreciate
the full impact. "These buildings are thousands of years old, built during a
time when people *believed the myths*", I think, and it slowly begins to
sink in.  "*There was a time when people believed in Athena, not as a
character in series of fictional stories, but as a actual object of worship,
and this temple is proof*".  I understand that everyone *knows* this, but
the reality of it hits you when you see the Parthenon up close.

Did people have the same arguments back then?  Did some people believe in
the literal truth of the myths, while others insisted that they were only to
be interpreted metaphorically?

As with any city, I suppose, Athens has its pleasant areas, its not so
pleasant areas, and its bustlilng areas.  Monastiraki square, with an
awesome view of the Acropolis high up on its perch, would count as bustling,
being so close to the flea market - mostly consisting of cheap tourist
shops, but with the occasional stall worth your time.  The Plaka is nice,
but in the same way that Old Montreal is nice: it's for tourists, and locals
don't hang out here.

That's the thing about Greece when you don't know Greek.  Venturing outside
the tourist zones is risky.  There's a very real chance you won't be able to
ask for directions if you get lost.  This was a theme that would crop up
again and again.

## Santorini

After Athens, we flew to Santorini.  This was a bit of an ordeal.  We bought
a cheap(ish) flight with Voltea, without realizing that you needed to check
in and print our your boarding passes at least two hours in advance of the
flight.  Failure to do so results in a 30 euro charge for each passenger.
We didn't notice the two hour limit, so we tried checking in with 30 minutes
to spare.  Ding!  60 euros please.

To rub salt in the wound, we forgot about the no liquids rule and we had to
ditch our sunscreen.  Double ding!  It was not a good day.  But we made it!

First impressions of Santorini: very noisy, very crowded.  In other words, I
am unimpressed.

At some point early in your stay, you make your way over to the caldera, and
all is forgiven.  The views, for lack of a better word, are jaw-dropping.  I
mean that quite literally; my jaw dropped a bit when I saw the caldera for
the first time.  There is a very good reason why this island is thick with
tourists.  I'm convinced that Greece dyes the sea blue.

We stayed in Fira, the main town in Santorini.  Attractive town, but crowded
and noisy, full of bars catering to people from all over the globe (Chinese
restaurant here, Irish pub there). It wasn't really my jam.

I *did* end up learning something about Greek food that I'm ashamed to say I
didn't already know.  "Souvlaki" refers to meat skewered on a stick, while
"gyros" refers to the shaved meat from a spinning vertical spit.  Add a
"pita" to the name, and you have the familiar wrapped sandwich, but
otherwise you get a plate with rice and salad.  I learned this when I
ordered a "souvlaki" thinking I was going to get a pita wrap.  Live and
learn, and now I know.

Oh, and I also learned, to my surprise, that I love [moussaka][1].

A boat tour around the caldera was much more fun than the Fira itself.  You
get to see the volcano up close, and you get to take in a 360 degree
panorama view of the caldera.  Again, jaw-dropping is not an exaggeration.

The boat let us off in Oia, at the tip of island.  Oia is just like Fira,
only prettier and quieter, mostly due to the lack of motorbikes on the
roads.  The place is stunning.  From certain angles, your breath catches a
bit in your throat.

## Rhodes

Our next stop after Santorini was Rhodes.  Evelyn and I had decided
beforehand to take the ferry.  We had bought the ticket in Montreal: 3-9pm,
it said.  Six hours.  Not so bad, right?

Ahahahahahaha!

The night before we're supposed to leave, we happen to show our ticket to
our hotel manager in Fira. who kindly points out that the ticket says 3am to
9pm.  That is...not six hours.  That is 18 hours, my friends.

18 fricking hours.

After a desperate and futile attempt to find another way off the island the
next day (we had a plane leaving out of Rhodes a couple of days later), we
suck it up and decide that the 3am ferry is our only option. The taxi picks
us up at 1:45am sharp and drops us off at the port, where a couple of other
hearty souls are waiting.

The ferry arrives 30 minutes late, and Evelyn makes me upgrade to a
cabin. Thank god for that; we collapse on our cots and sleep until noon the
next day. That's 8 hours dealt with. Small favours and all.

We end up being pleasantly surprised.  It turns out, mostly due to the fact
that we could actually sleep, that this was one of the better parts of the
trip!  You can walk around on deck, get some fresh air and you get to see a
bunch of different island ports from a distance - lovely, tucked away
places. I only wish we could have visited.

First impressions of Rhodes: less noisy, less crowded.  I am pleased.

The thing about Santorini - at least the parts we saw - is that it doesn't
feel like anyone actually lives there.  The whole thing looks like it exists
solely for the benefit of tourists which, to some extent, it does.

Rhodes was still very touristy, but it felt like locals actually lived
there, so I liked it.

We stayed in Rhodes Town.  The main draw of Rhodes Town is the Old Town.
Now, lots of cities have an Old Town (Montreal, Quebec City, Lyon) but
*this* Old Town was special in that a) it's huge and b) the architecture is
this oddly attractive mix of Byzantine and Ottoman styles.  It's also
differenciated from other Old Towns in that it doesn't just exist for the
benefit of tourists; people live there.

It was here where I tried my first stifado.  I feel it's worth mentioning
because it was freaking awesome and I want to learn how to make it.
