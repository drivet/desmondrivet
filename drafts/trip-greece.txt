Evelyn and I decided, on a whim, to travel to Greece this year. We went for
ten days.

This is the first time we've ever been overseas without knowing anyone at
the other end.  We've been to Lyon, of course, but we stayed at a friend's
apartment.  Furthermore, we both know enough French to make our way around
town, ask for directions, order food, read a train schedule, etc.

We landed in Athens, then moved on to Santorini, then to Rhodes, then to
Delphi and back to Athens.  It was a lot of moving about and I feel like we
saw a lot while simultaneously seeing very little.  Greece is the kind of
country where you can spit and hit a ruin.  This is only a slight
exaggeration.  We are, after all, talking about the cradle of Western
civilization.


The first thing I will note about
Evelyn's French is a lot better than mine but if this trip taught me
anything, it's that I underestimate the amount of French I know.
