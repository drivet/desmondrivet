Evelyn and I decided, more or less on a whim, to travel to Greece this
year. We went for ten days.

This was the first time we'd ever been overseas without knowing anyone at
the other end.  The one time we were in Europe together, in Lyon, we stayed
at a friend's apartment.

Our itinerary consisted of Athens, followed by Santorini, Rhodes, Delphi and
then Athens again.  This is quite a bit of moving about and I feel like we
saw a lot while simultaneously seeing very little.  Greece is the kind of
place where you can spit in a random direction and hit an ancient ruin.
This is only a slight exaggeration.  We are, after all, talking about the
cradle of Western civilization.  You can't hope to see more than a tiny
fraction of all there is to see in only 10 days.

## Athens

We landed in Athens, and stayed at a centrally located Airbnb. 

First impressions of Athens: very noisy, very crowded, very dirty, and very
grafittied.  In other words, I am unimpressed.

My opinion changed somewhat as I made the climb to the Acropolis.  There is
something surreal about this...fort? temple?...sitting proud and high on its
hill, keeping watch over the city.

The whole experience needed time to marinate a bit before I could appreciate
the full impact. "These buildings are thousands of years old, built during a
time when people *believed the myths*", I thought, and it slowly begins to
sink in.  "*There was a time when people believed in Athena, not as a
character in series of fictional stories, but as a actual object of worship,
and this temple is proof*".  I understand that everyone *knows* this, but
the reality of it hits you when you see the Parthenon up close.

Did people have the same arguments back then?  Did some people believe in
the literal truth of the myths, while others insisted that they were only to
be interpreted metaphorically?  Did they fight over it?

As with any city, I suppose, Athens has its pleasant areas, its
not-so-pleasant areas, and its bustlilng areas.  Monastiraki square, with an
awesome view of the Acropolis on its perch, would count as bustling, being
so close to the flea market - mostly consisting of cheap tourist shops, but
with the occasional stall worth your time.  The Plaka is pleasant, but in
the same way that Old Montreal is pleasant: it's for tourists, and locals
don't really hang out here.

That's the thing about Greece when you don't know Greek.  Venturing outside
the tourist zones is risky.  There's a very real chance you won't be able to
ask for directions if you get lost.  This was a theme that would crop up
again and again.

## Santorini

After Athens, we flew to Santorini.  This was a bit of an ordeal.  We bought
a cheap(ish) flight with Voltea, without realizing that you needed to check
in and print our your boarding passes at least two hours in advance of the
flight.  Failure to do so results in a 30 euro charge for each passenger.
We didn't notice the two hour limit, so we tried checking in with 30 minutes
to spare.  Ding!  30 euros each please.

To rub salt in the wound, we forgot about the no liquids rule and we had to
ditch our sunscreen.  Double ding!  It was a dark day.  But we made it!

First impressions of Santorini: very noisy, very crowded.  In other words, I
am unimpressed.

At some point early in your stay, you make your way over to the
[caldera][2], and all is forgiven.  The views, for lack of a better word,
are jaw-dropping.  I mean that quite literally; my jaw dropped a bit when I
saw the caldera for the first time.  There is a very good reason why this
island is thick with tourists.  I'm convinced that Greece dyes the sea blue.

We stayed in Fira, the main town on the island.  Attractive town, but
crowded and noisy, full of establishments catering to people from all over
the world (Chinese restaurant here, Irish pub there). It wasn't really my
jam.

I *did* end up learning something about Greek food that I'm ashamed to say I
didn't already know.  "Souvlaki" refers to meat skewered on a stick, while
"gyros" refers to the shaved meat from a spinning vertical spit.  Everybody
already knew that, right?  I feel silly.  Add "pita" to the name, and you
have the familiar wrapped sandwich, but otherwise you get a plate with rice
and salad.  I learned this when I ordered a "souvlaki" thinking I was going
to get a pita wrap.  Live and learn, and now I know.

Oh, and I also learned, to my surprise, that I love [moussaka][1].

A boat tour around the caldera was much more fun than Fira itself.  You get
to see the volcano up close, and you get to take in a 360 degree panorama
view of the caldera.  Again, jaw-dropping is not an exaggeration.

The boat let us off in Oia, at the tip of island.  Oia is just like Fira,
only prettier and quieter, mostly due to the lack of motorbikes on the
roads.  The place is stunning.  From certain angles, your breath catches a
bit in your throat.

We spent the next day at Kamari beach.  Nothing much to report about that,
except to say that the water was clear and perfect.  I don't know how they
do it.  Maybe all the salt kills the algae or something.

## Rhodes

### Prelude 

Our next stop after Santorini was Rhodes, as far east as you can get in
Greece before you hit Turkey.  Evelyn and I had decided beforehand to take
the ferry.  We had bought the ticket in Montreal: 3-9pm, it said.  Six
hours.  Not so bad, right?

Ahahahahahaha!

The night before we were supposed to leave, we happened to show our ticket to
our hotel manager in Fira. who kindly pointed out that the ticket said 3am to
9pm.  That was...not six hours.  That was 18 hours, my friends.

18 fricking hours.

After a desperate and futile attempt to find another way off the island the
next day (we had a plane leaving out of Rhodes a couple of days later), we
sucked it up and decided that the 3am ferry was our only option. The taxi
picked us up at 1:45am sharp and dropped us off at the port, where a couple
of other hearty souls are waiting.

The ferry arrived, and Evelyn maked me upgrade to a cabin. Thank god for
that; we collapsed on our cots and slept until noon the next day. That was 8
hours dealt with. Small favours and all.

We ended up being pleasantly surprised.  It turned out, mostly due to the
fact that we could actually sleep, that this was one of the better parts of
the trip!  You could walk around on deck, get some fresh air and you got to
see a bunch of different ports from a distance - lovely, tucked away
places. I only wish we could have visited.

### Rhodes Town

First impressions of Rhodes Town: less noisy, less crowded.  I am pleased.

The thing about Santorini - at least the parts we saw - is that it doesn't
feel like anyone actually lives there.  The whole thing looks like it exists
solely for the benefit of tourists which, to some extent, it does.

Rhodes was still very touristy, but it felt like locals actually lived
there, so I liked it.

Our hotel was in Rhodes Town.  It's main draw is the Old Town.  Now, lots of
cities have an Old Town (Montreal, Quebec City, Lyon) but *this* Old Town
was special in that a) it's huge and b) the architecture is this oddly
attractive mix of Byzantine and Ottoman styles.  A lot of it was built by
the Templars.  It's also differenciated from some other Old Towns in that it
doesn't just exist for the benefit of tourists; people actually live there.

It was here where I tried my first stifado (Greek stew).  I feel it's worth
mentioning because it was freaking awesome and I want to learn how to make
it.

### Lindos

The island of Rhodes has a ton of beaches.  We had time for just one, so we
picked Lindos.

There's not much to say about this one either.  How much can you say about a
beach?  The water was crystal clear blue, the beach was sandy, and was
overlooked by Lindos itself, with all its sugarcube houses.  It's pretty
idyllic.

## Delphi

The last stop on our trip, before our last night in Athens, was [Delphi][3].
The plan was to fly back to Athens, hop on a public bus to Delphi, spend the
night, visit the site the next day, and head back into Athens for the
evening.  The plan worked, but it was pretty tiring.

Stress level were pretty high as well.  We ended up at the wrong bus
terminal the first time around, and people we're not overly helpful or
friendly.  This wasn't a touristy area - these are the buses that locals
take to get around.  Therein lies the rub with Greece.  The tourist areas
are the way they are for a reason.  You can venture outside of them, but
doing so means managing a certain amount of stress, unless you know your way
around, and we didn't.

The bus trip itself was a treat.  The route takes you through mountainous
Greek countryside.  It was a different kind of stunning than Santorini, but
the word still applied.

Our hotel was fairly comfortable, and also sported a nice view.

First impressions of Delphi town: picturesque, but kind of dead, which was a
welcome change from the rest of Greece.  Most people, as it turns out, don't
actually stay here; they do day tours from Athens.  In retrospect that might
have been a good idea, as we managed to "do" Delphi in only four hours.

When you're actually walking through the site, it doesn't feel completely
real.  The place drips with historical significance (Alexander the Great
himself was said to have consulted the Oracle) and you feel a little bit
numb once you're there.  You have to keep pinching and reminding yourself:
you are walking through the fabled site of the Oracle at Delphi.  The
enormity of that fact takes a while to sink in.  And, as is the norm in
Delphi, the view is spectacular.

Across the road is the Temple of Athena.  Not quite the same historical
significance as the Oracle, but still quite an iconic site.
