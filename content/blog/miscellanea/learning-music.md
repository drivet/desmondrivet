In an attempt to at least *try* and get to know my theremin a bit better, I
caved and bought Carolin Eyck's [*The Art of Playing the Theremin*][1].  I
mean, her instructional videos on youtube are great, but they don't really
give you a proper sense of how to move your fingers when playing a tune.
Her book does.

It's probably obvious to everyone else in the world, and I'm not sure what
exactly I was expecting, but it turns out, quite reasonably, that you have
to know how to read sheet music in order to fully benefit from the book.
Crazy, right?

Unfortunately, to put it bluntly, I don't know the first thing about reading
sheet music.  What follows are some thoughts on learning the basics of this
new skill, from the perspective of a software developer starting almost
entirely from zero.
