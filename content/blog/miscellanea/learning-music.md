In an attempt to at least *try* and get to know my theremin a bit better, I
caved and bought Carolina Eyck's [*The Art of Playing the Theremin*][1].  I
mean, her instructional videos on youtube are great, but they don't really
give you a proper sense of how to move your fingers when playing a tune.
Her book, on the other hand, does.

It's probably obvious to everyone else in the world, and I'm not sure what
exactly I was expecting, but it turns out, quite reasonably, that you have
to know how to read sheet music in order to fully benefit from the book.
Crazy, right?

Unfortunately, to put it bluntly, I know sweet fuck all about reading sheet
music - or music in general, really.  What follows are some thoughts on
learning the basics of this new skill, from the perspective of a software
developer starting almost entirely from zero.

## Do Re Mi

Okay, so I'm not starting from *exactly* zero - only very close to it.  Like
most people, I was at least partially familiar with the Do-Re-Mi song from
The Sound of Music.  I understood, more or less, that the words were
sounding out the notes in an octave and that octaves "repeated" - a pitch
from one octave and the corresponding pitch from a higher octave were
perceived, in some sense, to be the same note, in what has been referred to
as "the basic miracle of music".

But I didn't really give the topic much thought beyond that.  I was under
the vague impression that you could basically play any tune you wanted with
only these 7 notes (repeated indefinitely).

I thought that, That is, until you read an article like [C major][2], where
the first paragraph reads:

> C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C,
> D, E, F, G, A, and B. C major is one of the most common key signatures
> used in western music. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps....
>
> On the piano, the C major scale can be played by playing the white keys
> starting on C.

So...there are a couple of things that stand out for me in that paragraph:

* there are scales other than Do-Re-Mi?
* what the fuck are sharps and flats?

## The Colour Wheel

I know what everyone is thinking:

"But Desmond! What did you think the black keys on a piano were used for?"

And with only a hint of exaggeration, I'm basically like:

"Ummm.  Jazz?"

The plain fact is that I really didn't give the black keys on a piano much
thought at all.  I didn't understand what role they played in a Do-Re-Mi
world so I kind of just ignored them.

All this led to my discovery of the Chromatic scale.  It's often depicted
like this:
