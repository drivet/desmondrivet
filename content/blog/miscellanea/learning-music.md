In an attempt to at least *try* and get to know my theremin a bit better, I
caved and bought Carolina Eyck's [*The Art of Playing the Theremin*][1].  I
mean, her [instructional videos][4] on YouTube are great, but they don't
really give you a proper sense of how to move your fingers when playing a
tune.  Her book, on the other hand, does.

It's probably obvious to everyone else in the world, and I'm not sure what
exactly I was expecting, but it turns out, quite reasonably, that you have
to know how to read sheet music in order to fully benefit from the book.
Crazy, right?

Unfortunately, to put it bluntly, I know pretty much nothing about reading
sheet music - or music in general, really.  Given that I really want to
learn how to play my theremin, however, I decided to give it a go.  What
follows are some of my first impressions while learning the basics of this
entirely new (to me) domain of knowledge, from the perspective of a 40 year
old software developer starting almost entirely from zero.

## Do Re Mi

Okay, so I'm not starting from *exactly* zero.  Like most people, I was at
least partially familiar with the [Do-Re-Mi][5] song from [The Sound of
Music][6].  I understood, more or less, that the syllables were sounding out
the notes in an octave and, furthermore, that octaves "repeated" - a pitch
from one octave and the corresponding pitch from a higher octave were
perceived, in some sense, to be the same note, in what has been referred to
as "the basic miracle of music".

I even understood, in my limited way, that you could sound out the Do-Re-Mi
musical pattern on a piano by hitting a certain contiguous sequence of white
keys.  And I knew that the sounds and the keys were associated with letters
(the Do sound was a C, I knew, and the Re sound was a D).

But I didn't really give the topic much thought beyond that.  The term
"major scale" had not yet entered my brain.  I was under the vague
impression that you could basically play any tune you wanted with only these
7 notes, repeated indefinitely as octaves do.

To be fair, I did have a vague notion that there existed these mysterious
notes called "sharps" and "flats", and I had a vague sense that they were
somehow related to the black keys on a piano, but I had no idea what role
they played in a Do-Re-Mi world, so I basically just ignored them.

It's weird, I know.  I mean, what did I think the black keys were used for?
Jazz?

## Major Scales and Colour Wheels

Read enough and you eventually learned that Do-Re-Mi is actually an example
of something called a [major scale][7], the [C major scale][2] to be
precise.

This tells me a couple of things:

* There are other major scales aside from C major.  There's more to music
  than Do-Re-Mi!
* The sharps and flats becomes important when you start constructing other
  major scales.


When you start reading about musical scales, you very quickly come across
two notions: a major scale and a chromatic scale.

you very soon come across
something called the chromatic scale.  It's often depicted as a circle like
this:

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> 
<img border="0"
     src="/blog/miscellanea/Pitch_class_space.svg" 
     alt="Chromatic scale" />
</div>

Chromatic means "colour" in Greek, and I'm not entirely sure why it's used
in this context.  Is it supposed to evoke the image of a colour palette?
Are notes considered "colourful" to certain people?  I don't know.

It's a bit of a simplification, but the chromatic scale basically embodies
all the notes that one ever hears in Western classical music.  I find it
amazing that the whole of Western music is built from a repertoire of only
12 notes, but there you go.

As someone mulling these things over for the first time in his life, I'm
immediately struck by the weirdness in labelling.  Why is there a note in
between C and D, that feels like it was added as an afterthought?
Conversely, why is there no note between E and F?  Or to put it another way,
why is C# not simply called a D?  It's the next note, after all.  Or, if you
insist on having sharps in between the notes, then why is F not called an
E#?

All things considered, why not just label the notes 1 through 12, or A
through L?

These kinds of questions become more pointed when you start reading about a
concept called a "major scale".  A major scale is collection of 7 notes with
the following frequency intervals:

whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half

A "half" in this context means one "hour" of the chromatic circle, so a
"whole" means two "hours".  A major scale is obtained by picking a note on
the circle and counting out the interval pattern above until you get to the
same spot again, thus obtaining an octave.

So if you start from C, you get C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and C again.  You've
just written out the C major scale, the simplest one because it skips all
the sharp notes in between and thus can be played using only the white keys
on a piano.  It's the only major scale with this feature; all the other
major scales have at least one sharp in them.  D major, for example,
consists of the notes D, E, F#, G, A, B, C# and D again.

## It's Still Confusing

The ongoing discussion, quite frankly, raised more questions than it
answered for me.

I mean, it's all very well and good to say that the C major scale skips all
the sharp notes, but *that's* only true because someone decided, seemingly
arbitrarily, that a major scale followed a certain interval pattern (W, W,
H, W, W, W, H) *and* furthermore decided that there was no sharp in between
E and F.

I mean, what's so special about a C major scale that we will seemingly bend
over backwards in order to be able to label its notes with simple, unadorned
letters - to the point where every *other* note in the chromatic scale is
labelled as a kind of "correction" to these notes?  I honestly don't know.

I get the impression that asking these kinds of questions is akin to asking
why a yard has 36 inches.  There's an answer, of course, but it's not
particularly germane to the task at hand, which is to measure something.

Of course, I can make what I hope are educated guesses.  If you look at the
interval pattern for a major scale (W, W, H, W, W, W, H) you can see that it
can be broken down into two patterns of intervals (W, W, H) separated by a
whole interval.

If you consider just C major, for example, you get the first group of notes
C, D, E, F and the second group of notes G, A, B, C, separated by a whole
interval.  The ratio in frequency between F and (lower) C is about 4:3, as
is the ratio between (upper) C and G.

I imagine that the ancient Greeks simply thought that these two notes
sounded nice together in that ratio.  If you consider that the
quintessential [lyre][3] has 4 strings, you can envision an ancient musician
choosing the first and last string to correspond to a 4:3 ratio, and then
filling in the middle two strings in a simple manner - one whole interval
apart, starting from the first string.  Label the strings with letters and
you have yourself the first 4 notes of a major scale.

Is this accurate?  I have no idea, but it seems plausible to me.  It's one
explanation, at least, for why C and D are double the distance of E and F.

Of course this *doesn't* explain why the notes in C major scale, in
particular, all get simple letters.
