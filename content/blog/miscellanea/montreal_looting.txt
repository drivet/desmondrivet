Title: Hockey and Looting
ctime: 1208882061

This will be a short entry.  The Montreal Canadians won the playoffs 
last night and some fans took this as an excuse to [act like
criminals](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/04/22/mtl-habs.html).

I just wanted to voice my extreme displeasure, for what it's worth. It's a 
game people. Get a fucking clue. And we *won*, morons.
