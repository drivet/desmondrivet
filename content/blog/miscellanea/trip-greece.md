Evelyn and I decided, more or less on a whim, to travel to Greece this
year. We went for ten days.

This was the first time we'd ever been overseas without knowing anyone at
the other end.  The one time we were in Europe together, in Lyon, we stayed
at a friend's apartment.

Our itinerary consisted of Athens, followed by Santorini, Rhodes, Delphi and
then Athens again.  This is quite a bit of moving about and I feel like we
saw a lot while simultaneously seeing very little.  Greece is the kind of
place where you can spit in a random direction and hit an ancient ruin.
This is only a slight exaggeration.  We are, after all, talking about the
cradle of Western civilization.  You can't hope to see more than a tiny
fraction of all there is to see in only 10 days.

## Athens

We landed in Athens, and stayed at a centrally located Airbnb. 

First impressions of Athens: very noisy, very crowded, very dirty, and very
graffitied.  In other words, I am unimpressed.

My opinion changed somewhat as I made the climb to the [Acropolis][9].
There is something surreal about this...fort? temple?...sitting proud and
high on its hill, keeping watch over the city.

The whole experience needed time to marinate a bit before I could appreciate
the full impact. "These buildings are thousands of years old, built during a
time when people *believed the myths*", I thought, and it slowly begins to
sink in.  "*There was a time when people believed in Athena, not as a
character in series of fictional stories, but as an object of actual
worship, and this temple is proof*".  I understand that everyone *knows*
this, but the reality of it hits you when you see the Parthenon up close.

Did people have the same arguments back then?  Did some people believe in
the literal truth of the myths, while others insisted that they were only to
be interpreted metaphorically?  Did they fight over it?

As with any city, I suppose, Athens has its pleasant areas, its
not-so-pleasant areas, and its bustling areas.  [Monastiraki square][5],
with an awesome view of the Acropolis on its perch, would count as bustling,
being so close to the flea market - mostly consisting of cheap tourist
shops, but with the occasional stall worth your time.  The [Plaka][6] is
pleasant, but in the same way that Old Montreal is pleasant: it's for
tourists, and locals don't really hang out here.

That's the thing about Greece when you don't know Greek.  Venturing outside
the tourist zones is risky.  There's a very real chance you won't be able to
ask for directions if you get lost.  This was a theme that would crop up
again and again.

## Santorini

After Athens, we flew to [Santorini][7].  This was a bit of an ordeal.  We
bought a cheap(ish) flight with Voltea, without realizing that you needed to
check in and print our your boarding passes at least two hours in advance of
the flight.  Failure to do so results in a 30 euro charge for each
passenger.  We didn't notice the two hour limit, so we tried checking in
with 30 minutes to spare.  Ding!  30 euros each please.

To rub salt in the wound, we forgot about the no liquids rule and we had to
ditch our sunscreen.  Double ding!  It was a dark day.  But we made it!

First impressions of Santorini: very noisy, very crowded.  In other words, I
am unimpressed.

At some point early in your stay, you make your way over to the
[caldera][2], and all is forgiven.  The views, for lack of a better word,
are jaw-dropping.  I mean that quite literally; my jaw dropped a bit when I
saw the caldera for the first time.  There is a very good reason why this
island is thick with tourists.  And I'm convinced that Greece dyes the sea
blue.

We stayed in Fira, the main town on the island.  Attractive town, but
crowded and noisy, full of places catering to people from all over the world
(Chinese restaurant here, Irish pub there). It wasn't really my jam.

I *did* end up learning something about Greek food that I'm ashamed to say I
didn't already know.  "Souvlaki" refers to meat skewered on a stick, while
"gyros" refers to the shaved meat from a spinning vertical spit.  Everybody
already knew that, right?  I feel silly.  Add "pita" to the name, and you
have the familiar wrapped sandwich, but otherwise you get a plate with rice
and salad.  I learned this when I ordered a "souvlaki" thinking I was going
to get a pita wrap.  Live and learn, and now I know.

Oh, and I also learned, to my surprise, that I love [moussaka][1].

A boat tour around the caldera was much more fun than Fira itself.  You get
to see the volcano up close, and you get to take in a 360 degree panorama
view of the caldera.  Again, jaw-dropping is not an exaggeration.

The boat let us off in Oia, at the tip of island.  Oia is just like Fira,
only prettier and quieter, mostly due to the lack of motorbikes on the
roads.  The place is stunning.  From certain angles, your breath catches a
bit in your throat.

We spent the next day at Kamari beach.  Nothing much to report about that,
except to say that the water was clear and perfect.  I don't know how they
do it.  Maybe all the salt kills the algae or something.

## Rhodes

### Prelude 

Our next stop after Santorini was [Rhodes][8], as far east as you can get in
Greece before you hit Turkey.  Evelyn and I had decided beforehand to take
the ferry.  We had bought the ticket in Montreal: 3-9pm, it said.  Six
hours.  Not so bad, right?

Ahahahahahaha!

The night before we were supposed to leave, we happened to show our ticket to
our hotel manager in Fira, who kindly pointed out that the ticket said 3am to
9pm.  That was...not six hours.  That was 18 hours, my friends.

18 fricking hours.

After a desperate and futile attempt to find another way off the island the
next day (we had a plane leaving out of Rhodes a couple of days later), we
sucked it up and decided that the 3am ferry was our only option. The taxi
picked us up at 1:45am sharp and dropped us off at the port, where a couple
of other hearty souls were waiting.

The ferry arrived, and Evelyn made me upgrade to a cabin. Thank god for
that; we collapsed on our cots and slept until noon the next day. That was 8
hours dealt with. Small favours and all.

We ended up being pleasantly surprised.  It turned out, mostly due to the
fact that we could actually sleep, that this was one of the better parts of
the trip!  You could walk around on deck, get some fresh air and you got to
see a bunch of different ports from a distance - lovely, tucked away
places.  I only wish we could have visited.

### Rhodes Town

First impressions of Rhodes Town: less noisy, less crowded.  I am pleased.

The thing about Santorini - at least the parts we saw - is that it doesn't
feel like anyone actually lives there.  The whole thing looks like it exists
solely for the benefit of tourists which, to some extent, it does.

Rhodes was still very touristy, but it felt like locals actually lived
there, so I liked it.

Our hotel was in Rhodes Town.  It's main draw is the Old Town.  Now, lots of
cities have an Old Town (Montreal, Quebec City, Lyon) but *this* Old Town
was special in that a) it's huge and b) the architecture is this oddly
attractive mix of Byzantine and Ottoman styles.  A lot of it was built by
the Templars.  It's also differentiated from some other Old Towns in that it
doesn't just exist for the benefit of tourists; people actually live there.

It was here where I tried my first stifado (Greek stew).  I feel it's worth
mentioning because it was freaking awesome and I want to learn how to make
it.

The same meal also saw me ordering an ouzo special (a long drink consisting
of Ouzo mixed with soda water) and I feel like this is a good point to pause
and say few words on Greek booze.  First, despite its presence in every
single tourist shop in Greece, no one actually drinks [Metaxa][4].  I'm not
sure why; I tried some and it's actually pretty tasty.  Ouzo is big, though,
much to my dismay.  It's not that ouzo is bad, exactly, but I just can't say
that I'm a big fan of anise flavoured liqueurs.  I feel the same way about
sambucca.  Every so often I'll try some (like I did with the ouzo special)
to see if my taste buds have changed, and I'm always vaguely put off.

### Lindos

We dipped our toes into the Mediterranean the first evening we arrived in
Rhodes.  The main town itself is fringed by a rather nice beach, so how
could we not?

We had time for just one more beach after that, so we picked Lindos.

There's not much to say about Lindos.  How much can you say about a beach?
The water was crystal clear blue, the beach was sandy, and was overlooked by
Lindos itself, with its myriad sugar cube houses.  It's pretty idyllic.

## Delphi

The last stop on our trip, before our last night in Athens, was [Delphi][3].
The plan was to fly back to Athens, hop on a public bus to Delphi, spend the
night, visit the site the next day, and head back into Athens for the
evening.  The plan worked, but it was pretty tiring.

Stress level were high as well.  We ended up at the wrong bus terminal the
first time around, and people we're not overly helpful or friendly.  This
wasn't a touristy area - these are the buses that the locals take to get
around.  Therein lies the rub with Greece.  The tourist areas are the way
they are for a reason.  You can venture outside of them, but doing so means
managing a certain amount of stress, unless you know your way around, and we
didn't.

The bus trip itself was a treat.  The route takes you through mountainous
Greek countryside.  It was a different kind of stunning than Santorini, but
the word still applied.

Our hotel was fairly comfortable, and also sported a nice view.

First impressions of Delphi town: picturesque, but kind of dead, which was a
welcome change from the rest of Greece.  Most people, as it turns out, don't
actually stay here; they do day tours from Athens.  In retrospect that might
have been a good idea, as we managed to "do" Delphi in only four hours.

When you're actually walking through the site, it doesn't feel completely
real.  The place drips with historical significance (Alexander the Great
himself was said to have consulted the Oracle) and you feel a little bit
numb once you're there.  You have to keep reminding yourself that you are
walking through the fabled site of the Oracle at Delphi.  The enormity of
that fact takes a while to sink in.  And, as is the norm in Delphi, the view
is spectacular.  It's not hard to see why the ancients called it the "navel
of the world".

Across the road was the Temple of Athena.  Not quite the same historical
significance as the Oracle, but still quite an iconic site.

## Back in Athens

We get back to Athens at roughly 7pm.  Our last night was spent in yet
another Airbnb.  This time we had the entire apartment to ourselves.

In the time we were gone, the PM had announced that he was calling a
referendum concerning Greece's debt.  During our first few days in Athens,
we saw very little evidence that Greece was in an economic crisis at all.
We saw more evidence of it now.  A society which had already looked upon
credit cards with suspicion suddenly started avoiding them like the plague.
The capital controls imposed by the PM, whereby Greek citizens were
forbidden from withdrawing more than 60 euros a day, did not apply to
foreigners and so any attempt to pay by credit card was usually met with a
pointed and slightly bitter "There's an ATM machine around the corner, and
you can take out as much as you want - unlike us."  Long(ish) lines at ATM
machines were not uncommon, though not nearly so bad at the news seemed to
make out.

## Final Thoughts

The phrase I've used to describe Greece is: equal parts stunning and
horrifying.  I stand by it.

Stunning is not an exaggeration.  Parts of Greece are simply gorgeous.  The
entire country is steeped in sun, scenery and history.

And tourists (I know, I know...I'm a tourist), and tackiness.  Hence the
horrifying.  I realize, as was pointed out to me, that I was a part of that.
And yet it somehow doesn't diminish the horrifying.

I think I've identified at least part of the issue.  When you go to a place
like Paris or Lyon they are, of course, crawling with tourists.  But most of
the places tourists go are still at least somewhat frequented by locals as
well.  This isn't the case in Greece.  There are what one might call
"tourist zones", which are almost like theme parks, and one tends not to
venture outside those areas.

This is, perhaps, our own fault for not being more adventurous.  I'm very
curious to know what Greece is like for someone who can actually speak and
read Greek.  I suspect even some rudimentary Greek would serve us well.

Maybe one day.
