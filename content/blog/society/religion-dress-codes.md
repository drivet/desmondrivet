A while back I wrote a [blog entry on the proposed Charter of Quebec
values][1].  I didn't like the proposal then and I don't like it now.

Soon after I wrote that article, the PQ ended up suffering a rather decisive
defeat, and so I mentally relegated the Charter to the dustbin of history.
I didn't think I would ever end up writing another one of these articles.

And yet here we are.  The newly elected CAQ government is proposing a
Charter 2.0 and is willing to apply the notwithstanding clause to get it.
The mind reels.

The CAQ's version of the Charter isn't quite as far-reaching as the PQ's.
Whereas the PQ would have banned the conspicuous display of any kind
religious paraphernalia by any government employee, the CAQ is proposing a
ban on religious symbols which extends merely to people in positions of
"authority", like judges, police officers and teachers.

My thoughts on the subject are still applicable now:

* This kind of "values charter" is almost never about protecting secularism.
  If protecting secularism were a priority, the cross in the National
  Assembly would come down.
  
* Secularism doesn't really need any extra protection.  To my knowledge
  there have been no cases in Canada of a person in a position of authority
  acting in anything but a religiously neutral manner.

* Even if such cases did exist, it's unclear how establishing a religiously
  neutral dress code would solve the problem.  One does not need a hijab,
  turban or yarmulke to let one's religious views affect one's judgment in
  civil matters - just ask [Kim Davis][2].

* How do you even decide what counts as "religious" in this context?  People
  are apparently willing to label the crucifix in the National Assembly a
  "cultural artifact"; why can't a yarmulke not count as such?  What about
  something as innocuous as a [long, black skirt][4]?

So many issues - in order to solve a non-problem.  It's hard to imagine that
this "values charter" is anything but an attempt to pander to the more
xenophobic elements in Quebec society.  You know, the kind who think that
immigrants are trying to [erase Christmas][3].

I'm saying all this so that people have no doubts where I stand on this
issue.  It's important to be clear on this point in light of what the rest
of this article is going to discuss.
