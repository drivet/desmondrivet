title: Bitterness is King
og_image: blog/food/negroni.jpg

[The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks][1], David Embury's classic, is notable for
being somewhat rigid in its definition of a cocktail.  He basically divides
all of cocktail-dom into two camps: the aromatic ones (Manhattans, Martinis,
Old-Fashioneds), and the sour ones (basically anything with lemon or lime
juice in it, though never enough to overpower the main liquor).

For Embury, a cocktail is consumed before dinner, stimulates the appetite,
and isn't very sweet - or it isn't a cocktail.  As such, though mixed drinks
like the Brandy Alexander and its cousins do show up on the pages of his
book, they are (justifiably, though somewhat condescendingly) classified as
desserts when made the traditional way (equal parts brandy, cream and creme
de cacao) or grudgingly allowed to stand alongside the *real* cocktails when
made according to his modifications (basically upping the brandy by four
times the usual amount relative to the other ingredients) - though with a
loud admonition that the result is vastly inferior to his tried and true
favourites.

Another cocktail that is notably missing from the pages of his book is the
[Negroni][2].  It's not hard to understand why when you see the standard
recipe:

**Negroni**

 * 1 part gin
 * 1 part Campari
 * 1 part sweet, red vermouth

The drink doesn't really fit into Embury's alcoholic taxonomy.  It's
certainly not a sour cocktail, and you'd be hard pressed to call it an
aromatic one (the gin would have to play a much, much larger role for that
designation to work).  So it's left by the wayside, a victim of its
undefinability.  Which is a shame because it makes an excellent pre-dinner
drink - the bitterness of the Campari is nothing if not appetite
stimulating.

Nothing about [Campari][3] is what you'd call *subtle*.  It's bright red,
extremely bitter, very sweet and it basically turns the Negroni into a
one-sided conversation. This cocktail yells at you.  If you like the subject
matter then you're good; if you do not, then you are most definitely not
good.

The Negroni evolved from a tamer drink called the [Americano][4].  The
recipe looks like this:

**Americano**

 * 3 cl Campari
 * 3 cl sweet, red vermouth
 * enough soda water to fill the glass

Legend has it that the Negroni came about when an Italian, Count Camillo
Negroni, asked a bartender to strengthen an Americano by swapping the soda
for gin.

Like the Negroni, the Americano is absent from Embury's book.  Though the
book does contain a chapter on "tall drinks" or "highballs" - of which the
Americano is one - they are not given the same level of prominence as the
short ones.

But also note that one can still make use of Embury's methods here.  The
basic takeaway from The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks isn't that there is only
one way of properly classifying cocktails.  The lesson, rather, is that one
can define the notion of a *cocktail template*.  Embury defined such
templates for [sour][11] and [aromatic cocktails][12], but went no further.

I suppose, then, it's up to the rest of us to fill in the gaps. So let's
define the *Negroni template*:

 * 1 part liquor (often gin, but sometimes not)
 * 1 part bitter
 * 1 part sweet
 
And the *Americano template*:

 * 1 part bitter
 * 1 part sweet
 * enough soda water to fill the glass
 
Obviously, the classic Negroni and Americano fall into those patterns but
other combinations work as well.  You can make, for example, an *Unusual
Negroni*:

**Unusual Negroni**

 * 1 part gin
 * 1 part Aperol
 * 1 part Lillet

[Aperol][5] is Campari's quiet little brother.  It's usually classified as a
bitter in the same drawer as Campari, except that it's much sweeter and more
citrusy.  [Lillet][6], as I've [mentioned before][7], has lost its quinine
over the years, and hence can be used as the sweet component of this
template.

Incidentally, Lillet is actually really good on its own, with a lemon wedge.
I find it tastes a bit like apricot sangria.  I find Aperol a bit too sweet
and fruity on its own, but your mileage may vary.

In the same vein you can make the *Unusual Americano*

**Unusual Americano**

 * 3 cl Aperol
 * 3 cl Lillet
 * top with club soda

I think I might have made up the name "Unusual Americano", but the name fits
here.  Both the Unusual Negroni and Unusual Americano are much sweeter than
their classic counterparts.  If you happen to like the bitterness of the
original Negroni, but want something a bit more complex, you can try the
[Boulevardier][8]:

**Boulevardier**

 * 1 part Rye or Bourbon
 * 1 part Campari
 * 1 part sweet vermouth

In between the classic Negroni and the Unusual Negroni is the *White
Negroni*, dubbed as such for fairly obvious reasons:

**White Negroni**
 
 * 1 part gin
 * 1 part Cocchi Americano
 * 1 part Lillet

We first met [Cocchi Americano][9] in the [Vesper][10] cocktail, where it is
barely detectable as a smoothing agent.  It's front and center in this
drink, though.  The bitterness of the Cocchi Americano is more pronounced
than the Aperol, though not quite as heavy as the Campari, so the White
version makes a good compromise between the classic and the Unusual.

The White Negroni is actually my favourite variation.  Though I am fond of
the classic Negroni, I have to be in the right mood for it; it's not an
easygoing drink.  The White Negroni, on the other, *is* an easygoing drink,
with just the right amount of sweet and bitter.

As before, you can make a version of the Americano out of this recipe:

**White Americano**

 * 3 cl  Cocchi Americano
 * 3 cl  Lillet
 * top with club soda

## Placating the Spirit of Embury

I will note one last thing before I go. Although the Negroni is absent from
Embury's book, it's not hard to turn it into a drink that could have fit on
its pages.  He did it himself with the Brandy Alexander. The basic trick is
to increase the liquor components in the cocktail until they becomes the
dominant flavour.  If you were to do this with the Negroni, you'd get
something like:

**Negroni (Spirit forward style)**

 * 4 parts gin
 * 1 part Campari
 * 1 part sweet, red vermouth

It's debatable whether this can still be called a Negroni.  Part of the
Negroni's charm is its simplicity - equal parts of everything in a glass
over ice.  I guess it's also debatable whether this can still be called an
"Embury style" drink; I suspect he would have increased the gin even more,
but that leads to a rather unpleasantly dry cocktail (I mean, have you seen
his recipe for a [sidecar][13]?  It's insane).

The above variation is more complicated to make and the gin, as expected, is
the dominant flavour.  Still though, it's a pretty good drink, especially if
you like gin more than you like Campari.

Personally, I think the "Embury" treatment works better on the Boulevardier:

**Boulevardier (Spirit forward style)**

 * 4 parts Rye or Bourbon
 * 1 part Campari
 * 1 part sweet vermouth

Again, is this *really* a Boulevardier?  I don't know but it's a good drink
nonetheless. It's tastes a bit like a Manhattan with a bitter kick. Generally
speaking, whiskey cocktails work well in their spirit forward variations,
though you need a decent whiskey for this to work.  Or maybe I just like
whiskey.

In any case, there's quite a lot of room for experimentation here.  Have
fun!
