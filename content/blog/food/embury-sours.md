title: Sour Cocktails and the Embury Ratio
---

Over the last couple of years I've put together what I consider to be a
fairly impressive home bar, and I've spent much of that time experimenting
with various cocktails.

There are people in my social circle for whom mixing drinks is a bit taboo.
When I say that I use [Calvados][1]) or [Cognac][2] in a cocktail, the first
reaction I usually get is "What a waste!"

I disagree.  My guiding principle with regard to cocktails is that you
should use good quality liquor that you'd have no problem drinking on its
own.  Calvados falls into this category, and so does Cognac.  It doesn't
have to be the really expensive stuff, but it should at least be middle
shelf.  The idea of making a cocktail out of foul tasting gut-rot in at
attempt to mask the taste is anathema to me.  When a cocktail is well made,
the extra ingredients *enhance* rather than mask the taste of the main
liquor.

My traditional ratio for a "sour" cocktail is 6/2/1.  That's 6 parts base, 2
parts lemon or lime, and 1 part 2-1 sugar syrup.  In concrete terms that
translates into 6cl of liquor, 2cl of lemon/lime and 2tsp of sugar syrup.
This yields a very sour, somewhat sweet drink, where the base can still
shine through.

Lately, I've been trying out [David Embury's][3] classic ratio of 8/2/1.
This is basically my ratio, with a third more liquor.  Again, in concrete
terms, this is 4cl of liquor, 1cl of lemon/lime, and 1tsp sugar syrup.  I
was skeptical, as this seemed like way too much liquor with respect to
citrus.  That being said, I gave it a shot (so to speak), and was surprised
to discover that it blew my 6/2/1 ratio out of the water.

The liquor is quite clearly the main flavour in such a cocktail.  In fact, I
hesitate to call it a "sour" since it's not actually very sour.  The citrus
is definitely there, but it complements and supports the liquor rather than
overpowering it.

This goes back to my main point, which is that you can't make this kind of
sour cocktail with gut rot.  The flavour is mostly carried by the liquor -
the sugar and citrus enhance but don't mask it.  So you need to use stuff
that you'd drink on its own.  And that means good whiskey or brandy.

So far, I've tried this ratio with rum, calvados and whiskey, and they're
all pretty awesome.
