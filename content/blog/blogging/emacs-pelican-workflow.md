[Pelican][1] is my blogging engine of choice these days.  Given that emacs
is often my text editor of choice, it made sense to try and streamline the
process of writing blog entries for pelican with emacs.  What follows is my
attempt to document such an endeavour, partly because I think it might be
useful to the (undoubtedly tiny) cross section of people who use both emacs
and pelican, but mostly so that I have something to refer back to when the
need arises.

The first step is to put your pelican blog under source control.  If you're
using pelican you're probably already doing this, but just in case you're
not, you should.  Not only is it just a good idea, but it also lets you use
projectile out of the box.

Most of the milage you will get out of using emacs to write yoyr blog
entries will come from using projectile.
