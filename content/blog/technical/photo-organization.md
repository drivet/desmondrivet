I have a large collections of digital photos, dating back over 15 years.
Not very many of them any good, but that's a different conversation,
probably revolving around my digital hoarding habits.

Anyway such a large collection deserves a particular style of organization.
Or maybe it doesn't.  Anyway, I have one! I thought I'd share in case anyone
finds it useful (including a future version of myself, my mind being a sieve
and all).

fdupes to remove duplicate photos

Use sortphotos python script to organize photos by date.  This is my first
line of organization.  I use the default year/month folder structure.

If there is an obvious way to sub-catgorize the photos within the folder
structure, I'll do that as well.  So, for example, if I went on a trip
during a month, I'll tuck those photos under a sub-folder named for the
trip.  So you'll occasionally see a folder hierarchy that looks like
year/month/category.
