In today's episode of "Desmond Feels Old", I'll be talking about the
IndieWeb, a community of people who are trying to repopularize the personal
website.

I've had some sort of web presence since about 1998 or so, when I made my
first hand-coded HTML pages available online at U of T.  CSS was barely a
thing.  Hell, HTML itself was barely a thing - it was only about 7 years at
the time.

It freaks me out a little bit to think that this was over 20 years ago.

They were *websites* in those days, not *webapps*, and if you weren't trying
to sell something, you had a *personal website*, not a Facebook account.
You wrote your pages, often by hand, and you *uploaded* them to a server.
If you were lucky, your hosting provider let you use CGI.

The subject matter was often estoric - fanpages were common.

## Enter the IndieWeb

Please believe me - I fully realize just how get-off-my-lawn-y I sound as I
write this.  

And don't misunderstand - no one is pining for the days when
you had to write entire websites by hand.
