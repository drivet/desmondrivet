I am an unapologetic Downton Abbey fan.  The series is full of memorable
scenes, but one in particular has stuck with me.  Daisy, one of the scullery
maids, when asked if she turned on the electric lights in one of the rooms,
replies "No.  I daren't".

Daisy is afraid of electricity.  It seems like such a minor, throwaway
scene, but it reveals quite a bit about how electricity was viewed in its
early days.
