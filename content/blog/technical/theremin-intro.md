I am an unapologetic Downton Abbey fan.  The series is full of memorable
scenes, but one in particular has stuck with me.  Daisy, one of the scullery
maids, when asked if she turned on the electric lights in one of the rooms,
replies "No. I daren't".

Daisy is afraid of electricity.  It's hard to imagine now, that there was a
time when electricity was _known_ but not _ubiquitous_.  It seems like such
a minor, throwaway line, but I feel like it succinctly captures how people
must have related to it back then.

I can only imagine how it must have seemed to uninitiated.  Horses, steam,
gas, water wheels, fire - these are all very visible and tangible ways to
power a machine, or to light a lamp.  But you never see electricity moving
or burning, even as you see the motor spinning or the lamp go bright.  It's
weird, when you think about it.

It must have seemed ghostly.  Spooky, even. 

And the idea that one could make music from this stuff - that one could
build a device to turn this abstract, invisible force into something
audible - must have been a hard one to swallow.

Hell, it must have been downright _unnerving_.

## Music from the Void

People often assume that electronic musical instruments were invented in the
1960's with the advent of the [synthesizer][2], but that's not quite not
true.  The world's first electronic musical instrument actually predates the
synthesize by a good 40 years.  It's called the _[theremin][1]_ and it
certainly qualifies as one of the most unusual instruments ever invented.
To my knowledge it is the only musical instrument that one plays with no
physical contact.

It consists of two metal rods which are usually called antenna, though they
do not operate on the same principles as, for example, a radio antenna.  One
of the rods is usually pointing in the air, and the other is usually curved
in a loop.  One controls the pitch by moving one's hand around the rod; the
closer your hand, the higher the pitch.  One controls the volume in the same
way, but with the looped rod; moving your hand closer makes the volume
lower.
