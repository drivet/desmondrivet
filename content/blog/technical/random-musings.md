title: Random Programming Thoughts
status: draft

I've been a programmer by trade ever since I graduated from University.
This is a fairly long time, as these things are measured.  I still consider
myself a novice, but that's a separate conversation.

My career, such as it is, mostly sidestepped the whole static versus dynamic
typing debate that roiled in the early 2000's.  School, when it veered into
software territory, mostly consisted of C and Java.  My working life, until
very recently, has been almost exclusively in C++ and Java.  One could say,
without much exaggeration, that my current employer *loves* static typing.
Even in the context of web applications, the preferred solution for a long
time was to use GWT over raw Javascript whenever possible.

For me, my every day programming languages were always statically typed.
Perl, Python, and Javascript were used, but not to the same extent, and
certainly not for anything that could be considered an "application".

I say that my every day programming languages were all statically typed, but
that requires some qualification.  It is more accurate to say that they
were statically typed *in the style of C++ and Java*.

This is an important point because while there are other statically typed
languages with a much different feel to them, the industry has mostly
embraced C++ and Java and so these are the languages that are inevitably
brought up in any static versus dynamic typing debate.  They are the
*canonical* statically typed languages, usually pitted against canonical
dynamically typed languages like Python and Ruby (and maybe Perl and
Javascript)

This muddies the waters somewhat, because Java's typing system can lead to
notoriously ceremonial code.  When people extol the virtues of a dynamically
typed language like Python, they are usually comparing it against a
statically typed language like Java.
