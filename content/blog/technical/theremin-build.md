I've known about theremins for a while, and I've always found them
fascinating, but I'd never taken the plunge and bought one, despite being
being tempted on many occasions.

At the same time, I've known about [Arduinos][4] for a long time, and I've
always wanted an excuse to buy one, but I've never taken the plunge and
bought one.  As I'm fond of saying, an Arduino is a solution in search of a
problem, and I just never found the right problem for it.

That is, until I found this website:

A chance to build a theremin out of an Arduino?  How could I pass this up?
I couldn't, that's how.

You have two choices if you want to build an Open Theremin.  You can [buy
the kit][8] or, if you're feeling brave, you can study the [schematics][7]
and build it from scratch.

I myself had two important but conflicting goals that I wanted to accomplish
with this project:

1. I wanted a working theremin
1. I wanted to learn something about electronics

I stood a much better chance of accomplishing (1) if I bought the kit.  I
stood a much better chance of accomplishing (2) if I built one from scratch.
I eventually decided to try for both; I bought the kit and started the
process of buying the component parts separately.

The kit basically consists of the board and control knobs; the electronics
are all pretty much pre-soldered; the knobs and LEDs, on the other hand, are
not.  You put it together, add an Arduino, connect the resulting monstrosity
to a pair of speakers and voila!  You have yourself a working theremin.

It all sounds very easy, and it is - if you know how to solder.  I was
reasonably good at it 20 years ago, but did I still have the knack?  Was it
like riding a bike?

The answer is...no.  Not even close.  Soldering was much harder than I
remembered it.
