title: Putting "Meta" in Front of Words Makes them Sound Cooler, Right?
---

One time, back when I was actually semi-active on Google+, I came across a
rather heated debate.  Someone had posted an [article][1] telling the story
of a child bride who had died on her wedding night.  The post was directed
accusingly at self-described proponents of "multiculturalism", an ideology
which, in the poster's opinion, was in the same category as "cultural
relativism", which he considered deeply depraved.

Unsurprisingly, the debate didn't center around the question of whether
[child marriage][7] was a horrific practice that needed to be roundly
condemned in the harshest terms possible - of course it was, and no one
needed convincing - but rather around the original poster's insistence on
conflating "multiculturalism" and "cultural relativism".  People were
insulted.

One of these days I'm going to write something about how people can become
emotionally attached to, or emotionally repelled by, certain charged
combinations of words.  Think of terms like "euthanasia" or "rape" or "life"
or "free will" or "consciousness" and you'll see what I mean.  I think the
original poster, in this case, had an emotional attachment to his own notion
of "multiculturalism" and seemed unwilling to entertain the idea that other
people might use the word differently.

I don't know the exact, academic definition of "cultural relativism".  The
everyday one off which I tend to base my opinions is that it's a version of
"ethical relativism".  It's the idea that you can't really categorize
cultures or, perhaps more accurately, cultural *practices*, as "good" or
"bad".  To put it more bluntly, it's the idea that one cannot label
[female circumcision][5], or child marriage, or [sati][4] as evil because,
well, that's just how they do things over there and who are we to judge?

I'll say it flat out: if *that's* your definition of "multiculturalism",
then it's not a philosophy to which I subscribe - but, then again, I don't
know anyone who does.  I'm not a logic expert, but I think this is what's
called a "straw man" argument - one defines a concept in such way that you
can't help but condemn it, but which bears little resemblance to way the
concept is actually (or often) used.  I, for example, adhere to a philosophy
that I *call* "multiculturalism", and yet I have no problem condemning a
host of practices that I would label as "barbaric" (this is not at all the
same thing, by the way, as advocating a dedicated
["barbaric practices" tip line][6].  As far as I know, we already have one;
it's called "911")

All that being said, here's where it gets a little hazy and here's where I
can see some people misconstruing my beliefs.

Like most rational people, I'm unwilling to judge an entire people by the
presence of a few bad apples but, more than that, I'm also unwilling to
judge an entire *culture* by the presence of a few bad *practices*.  For me,
the term "multiculturalism" unpacks to something resembling a form of
libertarianism: a kind of marketplace or buffet of cultures, where you get
to pick and choose the best (or at least neutral) bits from each, and reject
the rest.

Female circumcision is, obviously, evil, but praying five times a day facing
Mecca is not and accepting one does not mean accepting the other.  Cultures
are not *monolithic*.  They are not *package deals*.  Recognizing this truth
isn't ethical or cultural relativism.  I'm very willing to label certain
cultural practices, and the people who observe them, as unambiguously evil,
but I'm unwilling to *define* an entire culture by its unsavoury elements.
I simply try to pick the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, and go on from
there.

## The Metaculture

I'm pretty conventional when it comes to liberal, western values.  I believe
in free speech, freedom of religion, etc.  There are some people who take
this to mean that I cannot, therefore, be a multiculturalist, as if the
belief that there are such things as shared national values somehow negates
the term.

They are, of course, wrong.  They're mistaken as to what the term means.
More importantly, I believe they're mistaken as to what constitutes a
culture.

I have [said it before][2]: I don't think there is such a thing as a strong
Canadian culture, in the same sense that one would refer to a strong French
culture or a strong Chinese culture.  Freedom of speech, freedom of
religion, these *do not count* - not in the way some people think.  These
are not cultural artifacts, from my perspective.  They are basic human
rights.  Far from negating the concept of multiculturalism, they are
actually necessary for it to work at all.  They are the basic substrate
underpinning civilized human and cultural interaction.

Together they form, for lack of a better word, a *metaculture* - a culture
*about* cultures.  A general strategy for dealing with people who come from
different parts of the world and who now live together in the same physical
space.  The term is generalized from words like, for example, "metalogic"
(logic about logic) and metablogging (blogging about blogging).

I believe in a strong Canadian metaculture.  And yes, some parts of some
cultures clash with this strong metaculture and must be rejected.  This is
not the same as rejecting the entire culture.  I know it's a cliche, but one
does not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

I've sometimes heard Canada's policy of multiculturalism contrasted against
the American version by calling the former a "salad" and the latter a
"melting pot".  I don't know how fair that comparison is, but I like the
idea of being part of a salad.  Come as you are you, as they say.  It makes
life more interesting.
