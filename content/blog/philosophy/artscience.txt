title: The Intersection of Art and Science
---

Someone at work commented that, one night, she got into a long rambling
discussion about the intersection between art and science. I said that art
and science don't intersect, and she said she disagreed.

It's possible that there is a disagreement over terminology. When one says
that art and science "intersect" I have in my mind some kind of act that
combines the two, i.e. discovering some objectively reproducible feature of
the universe by painting a nice picture would count as an intersection
between art and science because by doing one, you're doing the other.

In my mind, just *using* the results of one field in another doesn't count
as an intersection. So a musician using an electronic keyboard doesn't count
as an intersection between music and electrical engineering and a sculptor
making something out of clothes doesn't count as an intersection between
sculpture and textiles.

Of course, someone can be both and artist and scientist, but insofar as s/he
is being one, I suspect s/he is not being the other. One could argue that
Einstein was being an artist when he came up with relativity, because the
entire theory was (so I understand) motivated by his sense of
aesthetics. But when it came time to show its worth as a theory, one had to
be scientist, and one had to use the theory to make predictions, and then
test those predictions out. If the theory had failed here, no amount of
elegance would have saved it.

(The scientific method is more or less agnostic on the issue of how one
comes up with theories. They just have to be testable, which is why string
theory is looked upon with a skeptical eye. So I've heard.)

That being said, I suppose that if a painter were, for example, to make his
own paints, and was convinced that his specially designed method for making
paint produced more vibrant colours than any other method, and there were an
actual, objective way to measure the "vibrancy" of paint colours, and he
tested out his paint by producing a series of pictures, each using a set of
paints produced by tweaking his paint producing methods, then this might
count as an intersection of science and art.
