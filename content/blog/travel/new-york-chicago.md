As you walk down a typical street in Manhattan the first thing you notice is
just how _straight_ it is.  Roads in Manhattan have actual vanishing points,
like railroad tracks.  You walk slowly towards this point that you will
never reach, and the cross streets come up one at a time, at perfectly
spaced intervals and at perfectly right angles.  First you look left, and
then you look right, and you're taken aback at how perfectly straight
_those_ roads are as well, and how they _also_ seem to go on forever in the
distance.

It feels like Manhattan is made up entirely of infinite streets.  It's so
big you that feel like you're missing out on most of it, like each road you
pass on your way to your destination is a lost opportunity, a story you'll
never get to hear.  You feel like there are countless Woody Allen movies and
Seinfeld episodes going on at the same time but you'll never know anything
about them because you didn't choose to walk down _those_ roads.  The sense
of loss can be very powerful.

Paradoxically, Manhattan can also feel claustrophobic. You feel like you're
jostling for space with every other inhabitant of the City.  The buildings
are mind-numbingly tall, and some of them are even beautiful, but you rarely
see them "in the distance", unlike the vanishing poin that you'll never
reach, and you often have to crane your neck to get a good view.

On the other hand...

New York City may be home to countless stories but Chicago is home to just
one.  It's a good one, though, and it takes place at night, in the rain,
with slick, shiny roads reflecting garish and lurid neon signs above an
endless parade of shady establishments.  It's a story populated by men who
wear fedoras and carry guns and conduct questionable business in secret
alleyways beneath the L train, and with dangerous, dagger-wielding women who
wear blood-red lipstick and blood-red evening gowns and blood-red shoes.
Women who'll kill you with a dismissive, disdainful look _before_ they bury
a knife in your back.

Chicago does not feel as claustrophobic as Manhattan.  The streets are wider
and the skyscrapers are laid bare in front of you like a metropolis-sized
picnic made of concrete and steel, inviting you - nay, _daring_ you! - to
gawk.  The buildings look like they belong in a different era, because they
_do_, and it's almost as if your eyes begin to involuntarily develop the
ability to see the world in sepia.

Drinking in Chicago feels naughtier than drinking in New York City, given
the former's history.  It's stupid - I mean, New York had Prohibition and
gangsters too, but somehow they just don't stick out like they do in
Chicago.  New York just doesn't seem as gritty, which is weird because New
York is physically so much dirtier than Chicago and New Yorkers are so much
ruder.  And yet, somehow, you leave New York with the sense that anything is
possible, while you leave Chicago with the sense that the Man will always
get you in the end.

Chicago.  Photos are available in my [gallery][1]]_
