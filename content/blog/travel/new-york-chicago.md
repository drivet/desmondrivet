As you walk down a typical street in Manhattan the first thing you notice is
just how _straight_ it is.  Roads in Manhattan have actual vanishing points,
like railroad tracks.  You walk slowly along and the cross streets come up
one at a time, at perfectly spaced intervals and at perfectly right angles
and you look down _those_ streets and you're taken aback at how perfectly
straight _they_ seem as well, and how _they_ seem to go on forever.

Manhattan is so big you that feel like you're missing most of it, like each
road you don't go down, which is most of them, is a lost opportunity, a
closed door, a story you'll never get to hear.  You feel like there are
countless Woody Allen movies going on at the same time but you'll never know
anything about them because you didn't choose to walk down those roads.

It's weird but, paradoxically, Manhattan can also feel claustrophobic. It
feels small and big at the same time. You feel like you're jostling for
space with every other inhabitant of the City.  The buildings are
mind-numbingly tall, and some of them are even beautiful, but you rarely see
them "in the distance", and you often have to crane your neck to get a good
view.

While New York City is home to countless stories, Chicago is home to just
one, but it's a good one, and it takes place at night, in the rain, with
slick, shiny roads reflecting garish neon signs above an endless parade of
shady establishments.  It's a story populated by men who wear fedoras and
carry guns and conduct questionable business in secret beneath the L train,
and with dangerous women who wear blood-red lipstick and blood-red evening
gowns and blood-red shoes and (occasionally) blood-red hair, and who carry
sharp, hidden daggers.
