The thing about New York City is that I unavoidably see it through the lens
of countless Woody Allen movies.

Manhatten is loud, rude and compressed.  The urban bakcground noise mostly
consists of honking.

The thing about Chicago is that I unavoidbaly see it through the lens of The
Untouchables.

Chicago tells one story, just one, and that story takes place at night, in
the rain, with slick, shiny roads reflecting garish neon signs above an
endless parade of shady establishments.  It's a story populated by men who
wear fedoras and carry guns and conduct questionable business in secret
beneath the L train, and with women who wear blood-red lipstick and
blood-red evening gowns and blood-red shoes and (occasionally) blood-red
hair, and who carry sharp, hidden daggers.
