I use a static site generator, and one of the nice things about this is that your *entire* site can be generated from the contents of your local folder.  When part of your content (your photos) live somewhere else (a media server, or a CDN, or whatever), that's no longer the case.\r\n\r\nThis bothers me somewhat, though I don't lose any sleep over it.  I don't really have a good answer for it.\r\n\r\n"], "in-reply-to": ["https://jlelse.blog/micro/2020/03/photos-workflow/"], "published": ["2020-03-06T12:19:41.269917"]}}
