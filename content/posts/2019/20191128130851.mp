No garlic, no basil, no olive oil.  It tastes like you'd think - like butter and tomato, with a whisper of onion.  Delicious. Didn't change my life, but I definitely added it to my weeknight repertoire.\r\n"], "mp-syndicate-to": ["twitter_bridgy_no_link"], "published": ["2019-11-28T13:08:51.755590"]}}
