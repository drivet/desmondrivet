title: The Moral Basis for the Right to Health Care
---

> Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a
troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left
to irresponsible action.  -- George Washington, in a speech of January 7, 1790

The moral basis for a right to health care seems almost a dead issue in
today's political and legal climate. To claim that health care is not a
fundamental right would be political suicide for any party or person seeking
election to any legislative body. Even the so-called right wing parties of
recent notoriety claim that this right is *limited* but that it still
exists. Philosophically, the issue is not a hotbed of debate either; the
view that there exist some kind of right to a decent minimum of health care,
or that the principle of beneficence is enough to justify socialized
medicine, permeates much of today's philosophical literature. Robert
M. Veatch, for example, asserts that "The principle of justice for health
care could...be stated as follows : People have a right to needed health
care to provide an opportunity for a level of health equal as far as
possible to the health of other people." <sup>1</sup> His view is grounded
in the concept of justice and rights, with somewhat of a disdain for the
principle of autonomy : " I see justice not just as a way to efficiently
improve the lot of the least well off by permitting trades ... That would
might be efficient and might preserve autonomy, but it would not be
justice." <sup>2</sup> Allen E. Buchanan, on the other hand, although coming
to the same practical conclusions (the establishment of universal health
care), grounds his arguments in the principle of beneficence, and
deliberately avoids any talk of the principle of justice: "...advocates of a
coercively backed decent minimum [of health care] have operated on the
assumption that such a policy must be based on a universal right to a decent
minimum. The chief aim of this article is to show that this assumption is
false." <sup>3</sup> Most philosophers, with few exceptions, fall into one
of these categories, or in between, with disagreement centering mainly on
what constitutes a decent minimum or whether a decent minimum is, in fact,
enough to discharge the implied duty of beneficence and/or the principle of
justice.

There are radically opposing viewpoints, but not as many. According to H.
Tristram Engelhardt Jr., for example, "A basic human right to the delivery
of health care, even to the delivery of a decent minimum of health care,
does not exist." <sup>4</sup> His view is also grounded in the principle of
justice, but he takes the principle of beneficence seriously; "It may very
well be unfeeling or unsympathetic not to provide
[health care to those who need it], it is another thing to show that one
owes others such help in a way that would morally authorize state force to
redistribute resources."  <sup>5</sup> He argues that it is moral to
voluntarily provide this helping hand (fulfilling a duty of beneficence),
but *immoral* to use state force to the same end. This leads him to claim
later that his "analysis of the principles of autonomy and beneficence and
of entitlements to property support a two-tiered system of health care."
<sup>6</sup> Noted philosopher Ayn Rand was also of this view, only she went
so far as to claim that even a two tiered was immoral, and that the only
*moral* health care system was a fully privatized one.

This is the current state of affairs in the debate over the moral right to
health care. Having stated this, I submit that there can be no such thing as
a moral right to health care (that there is no moral basis for this right),
in the sense that would justify state coercion of non-criminal
citizens. This view will be fully developed and justified with an appeal to
rule utilitarianism.

Much of the modern debate surrounding the issue of health care rights
implicitly assumes that these rights exist and then move the discussion
forward to questions of practical implementation. It is this very notion
that the moral right to health care exists, however, that the author wishes
to question. At the root of any justification of these rights lies the
never-questioned, never-doubted belief that it is *ethical* and *good* to
use state or societal *coercion* to force those who have appropriate
resources to use them in a way that is consistent with the production of
universal health care. The issue is one of the morality of coercive
beneficence, or alternatively, what constitutes a just action (they are not
equivalent). In essence, the main moral question to ask, before any other
debate can occur, is not *how much money (forcibly wrested by society from
private, non-criminal citizens) can be morally devoted to the production of
a universal health care system?* but rather, *is it moral for society
to forcibly wrest (i.e. use the power of a gun) resources from private,
non-criminal citizens to fund whatever health care system society has in
mind?*

Before one can even begin to answer such a question, let alone justify the
end result, one first has make clear the terms that will used throughout the
course of the discussion. The term *rights* will come up often so I shall
define a right to be a *morally enforceable claim to a certain object or to
do a certain act*. Entire books have been written on this topic, but since
there seems to be no iron clad definition (see, for example, <cite>The
Virtue of Selfishness</cite>, by Ayn Rand and <cite>An Approach to
Rights</cite>, by Carl Wellman), I will use the one formulated above. In a
perfect world this formalization would immediately translate into a *legally
enforceable* claim, but this is not necessary for a discussion of the
*moral* basis of a right to health.  In essence the above statement outlines
one case when the power of force can be morally used, i.e. the power of
force can be morally used when it is defending a right. This is very closely
related to the principle of *justice* as outlined in <cite>The Principles of
Biomedical Ethics</cite> by Beauchamp and Childress. When one thinks of
*justice* terms like *fairness*, *desert* and *entitlement* come to
mind. More to the point, *one who has a valid claim based in justice has a
right, and is therefore due something* <sup>7</sup> The foregoing
discussion, of course, entirely glosses over the issue of what exactly
constitutes a morally enforceable claim or, stated another way, *which
enforceable claims are just*. Once this is determined, the existence or
non-existence of a moral right to health care can easily be resolved.  More
easily defined than *rights* and *justice* is the concept of *society*. I
shall merely define it (in this context) as a collection of individual
people living within a certain geographical space.  There are certain
people, of course, who claim that society is something more than this, but
most would agree that the term society means at least this much.

It was mentioned before that the question to ask in the debate on health
care rights was: *is it moral for society to forcibly wrest (i.e. use the
power of a gun) resources from private, non-criminal citizens to fund
whatever health care system society has in mind?*.  The position of Robert
M. Veatch (and he is typical of those who share his views; differences
mainly arise in issues of practical implementation, not in the main
philosophical viewpoint) , in his essay "Justice, the Basic Social Contract
and Health Care", is clear: "The principle of justice for health care
could...be stated as follows : People have a right to needed health care to
provide an opportunity for a level of health equal as far as possible to the
health of other people." Let us examine what the implications of this
assertion are in full.

Health care is not free, and appropriate resources must be obtained before
any such system can be built. It is the method that Mr. Veatch suggests (the
use of state force) for acquiring these resources that leads to one of the
most fundamental, underlying assumptions of the above position : that
*private, individual property does not exist*. This becomes clear when the
concept of *owner* is emphasized: the owner of a resource is the person or
persons who have *ultimate moral authority over its use*.  The "moral"
qualifier, in this case, is important; a burglar might take your telephone,
and may do it in such a way that you will no longer have any practical say
in how it is used, but you are still the owner, since you are the one who
has moral authority over its use. This notion is closely tied to concept of
*property rights*. Stated another way, one can say that the owner of an
object is the person who has the *moral right* to use that object as he sees
fit. Following this line of logic, and this definition of *owner*, one can
see that if society has the final word on the use of certain resources, if
it can *morally* dictate their use, then by definition society owns these
resources. Furthermore, this conclusion is not changed by the fact that
individuals may *possess* property throughout theirs lives. A right to a
certain piece of property, with no accompanying right to use it *whenever*
one chooses, is not a right at all. The opposite of possessing something by
*right* is possessing something by *permission* and, in fact, this is the
nature of all forms of possession in a society that claims the moral right
to forcibly wrest resources from individual citizens. Individuals control
property by *permission* of society (since society holds the final authority
over its use), which can be revoked, or changed at any time. Without
invoking any moral judgment, this is the form of society that Mr. Veatch
envisions. Moreover, since *society* as a strict entity does not exist as
such, but is merely a collection of individuals, what the above position
translates into in practice is the moral right of *some people* to forcibly
wrest property (such as money) from *other people*.

Mr. Veatch's position could perhaps be justified if it could be
shown that society as a whole were the rightful owner of these
resources. To show that the above position is not justified, however,
one has to demonstrate that individual people have ultimate moral
authority over the property they have earned or produced. This is
fairly easy to do using a few basic facts about the nature of human
survival.

Few would argue that in order to survive for any significant length of time,
people must produce the necessities of life. They must *produce* their
shelter (by building huts, cabins, houses or skyrise apartment buildings),
they must *produce* their food (by planting crops or hunting animals), and
they must *produce* their clothing (animal skins, cotton dresses, blue
jeans). Production is the key word here; without production, men and women
would die after their first winter, flood, volcanic eruption, tornado, or
any natural disaster. The fruits of production are the necessities and
resources of life. Furthermore, this fact of reality is unaltered by the
existence of trade. The development of trade is the natural next step when
the methods of production become more and more refined. Men and women may
produce more of a certain resource then they strictly need, and so trade
with other men and women to obtain other resources that they may not
have. In time, things get to the point where certain people devote
themselves entirely to the production of one resource, in order to trade
their surplus for their entire necessities of life. More to the point, to
say that this type of human survival is a *societal* concern shows a
misunderstanding of the term *society*. "Society" does not produce food;
farmers *do*. "Society" does not produce clothes; tailors *do*. *"Society"
does not make money; people do*. To say, then, that these people do not have
the moral right to these resources (clothing, food, money), and ultimate
authority over how they are used, whether they are traded or destroyed or
saved in their original form, is to say that people do not have the right to
support their own lives. When the moral right to own property is denied, the
*moral right to life* is denied as well. If people keep the resources they
earn "by permission", then they live "by permission" as well. Without
bothering to argue the good and bad consequences of denying people a right
to life (as utilitarianism requires), I will simply assert that, because the
right to private property - the right to *ownership* - is inseparable from
an individual's right to life, people must be given the final, ultimate word
over the resources they have earned. To put this in terms of the principles
of justice : it cannot be just to use force to take property away from the
people who have earned it. It follows that there cannot be any moral right
to another person's property. This automatically precludes the existence of
moral positive rights (i.e. rights to a certain object owned by someone
else). This also eliminates from the realm of moral consideration
Mr. Veatch's version of justice to which his claim to morality hinges. In
other words, the views expressed by Veatch are fundamentally unjust. In
fact, there is a specific name for the policy he advocates : it is called
*theft*. <sup>8</sup>

Moreover, since Veatch's claim is not grounded in justice (despite his
assertion that it is), it becomes nothing more than an attempt to justify
the policy of enforced beneficence. In this respect, his views are very
similar to those of Allen E. Buchanan's, who asserts explicitly that his
policy of a decent minimum standard of health care is not based on any right
as such, but on the idea that stealing resources from individual people is
moral if it is done in the name of the principle of beneficence.

I submit that this position is a moral obscenity, and shall proceed to
justify that assertion with the moral theory of rule utilitarianism.  In
essence, rule utilitarianism asserts that the moral action is the one that
conforms to a specific rule or policy that has been previously justified by
the principle of utility, or the principle of maximizing "good" consequences
over "evil" consequences (i.e. the moral policy is the one that produces the
most "good" consequences and produces the least "evil" consequences). This
somewhat formal definition glosses over the problem of what exactly
constitutes the "good"; the standard varies from theory to theory, all of
which can be labeled as utilitarian. The author shall choose to call "human
life" (its quality and its existence) the standard of the good in this
particular context; it is as reasonable a standard as any, and it seems
almost axiomatic that in any calculation of the "good", human life must be
given an extremely prominent place. It is a small step from there to the
assertion that " human life" is *the* "good".

The ultimate question of rule utilitarianism is, in the words of Beauchamp
and Walters, "What good and evil consequences will result generally from
this sort of action?" Let us ask, therefore: *What would happen if some
people, in general, routinely stole property and resources from other
people, in the name of the principle of beneficence, in order to pay for a
universalized system of health care?* To be perfectly fair, this would
definitely have some good consequences. People unlucky enough to be stricken
sick, and who could not normally afford private health care, provided by
people who have devoted their resources towards this end, would not have to
rely on private charities for their well being. From the standpoint of human
life, and taken strictly by itself, this is, of course, a desirable
outcome. Who would have a reason to say that it is not? This is, in itself,
however, no justification, and when the impact of this policy on society in
general is examined closely, things begin to change.

As implied before, the opinion stated above essentially amounts to
morally endorsed theft. What sort of evil consequences does this type
of policy generate? Firstly, if such a policy is adopted strictly on
the basis of the principle of beneficence - as it must be, since I
have shown that there is no moral right to another person's property -
there can be no objective standards to decide when "enough"
resources have been stolen. There was some talk, previously, of
assuring a decent minimum standard of health care as a theoretical
limit on the power of moral expropriation, but that in itself is an
undefinable term. Beyond prescribing soap for disease prevention and a
bottle of aspirin a year, what exactly is a "decent
minimum"? Can a $1,000,000 medical procedure be considered part
of a "decent minimum" health care plan, and guaranteed to
all when the need arises? If not, what principle dictates that the
setting of broken bones be put under the same heading?

Many philosophers and political scientists attempt to resolve the above
difficulties by claiming that any policy of morally sanctioned theft will be
properly tempered by financial considerations. It is realized, the argument
goes, that people live by the property they earn, and so, when all of
"society's" resources are redistributed, it will be made sure that, in the
end, everyone possesses enough to live on. It is this consideration that
supposedly defines the aforementioned decent minimum standard of health
care. Usually such a scheme involves differentiating between a *luxury* and
a *necessity of life*. Theft can only be morally justified when the resource
involved is a luxury (to the person you're stealing it from) and not a
strict necessity of life (so the argument goes). This statement becomes
dubious when it is realized that almost everything we take for granted in
today's civilization is a luxury.  Certainly cars, buses, ice cream, pants,
shirts, televisions, radios, telephones, computers, non-leaky homes, leaky
homes, three meals a day, soft drinks, coffee, tea, sugar, milk, juice,
hats, music, theatre, movies and books are all *luxuries* in the strict
sense of the term. In fact, if one wants to be technical, everything above a
piece of raw meat, a bear skin, and a cave is a luxury. So what moral
principle would prevent the reduction of mankind to the material state of
medieval serfs, in the name of a decent minimum standard of health care, if
a "decent minimum" can basically mean whatever anyone wants it to mean?
Even Mr. Veatch states that "society would rather *arbitrarily* set
some fixed amount of the total resources for health care [italics mine]"
<sup>9</sup>. This leaves the door wide open for any potential dictator with
a yen to cure the country to impose his views on competent people who may
not agree with him. By forcing his views competent people, this potential
dictator becomes a forcible arbitrator of ideas. The free exchange of ideas
is an absolute necessity in a free society. If a free society is the most
conducive to human life (as seems to be the case; the bloodiest societies on
earth tend to be those that dispense with human freedom), and if human life
is a standard of the good, then one must conclude that the very concept of
enforced beneficence brings about major evil consequences. Moreover, it
seems fairly obvious that the evil consequences stemming from this coercion
outweigh the possible good it might accomplish, since we are talking of the
total deprivation of liberty of huge numbers of citizens as opposed to the
lack of health of a few people who cannot afford private health care. In
light of all this, it is obvious that the most general rule to adopt in this
case, that is, the rule which offers the most utility, is: *do not enforce
the principle of beneficence*. Stated in a more specific way, this rule
reads: *do not steal from other people, even in the name of
beneficence*. The principles of justice and autonomy must outweigh all
others.

This view is not shared by many people in the philosophical community. The
views of H. Tristram Engelhardt Jr. come close; as stated before, he
believes that "A basic human right to the delivery of health care, even to
the delivery of a decent minimum of health care, does not exist. " His sees
enforced beneficence as fundamentally unjust, but he still takes the
principle of beneficence seriously : "It may very well be unfeeling or
unsympathetic not to provide [health care to those who need it]; it is
another thing to show that one owes others such help in a way that would
morally authorize state force to redistribute resources." As far as can be
gathered from his writings he supports a *voluntary* two-tired system of
health care. The issue of whether it is moral to help those in need, without
being forced to, is a matter for another debate. The key concept here is
that Engelhardt does not believe in *enforced beneficence*, and, in this
sense, I have implicitly defended his position above.

In conclusion, after a rigorous evaluation of the good and evil consequences
of adopting a policy of institutionalized theft, or enforced beneficence, it
is evident from an appeal to the principle of utility and an adoption of
human life (quality and existence) as a standard of the good, that such
general actions fail the test of utility, cannot morally be made into a
rule, and hence is not moral in general. To be brief, there is no moral
basis for the "right" to health care. Since absolute private property can be
defended on the basis of the right to life, any policy that advocates the
forcible wresting of resources from individual citizens is excluded from the
realm of moral consideration and of justice.
