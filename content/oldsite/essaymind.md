> The imitation man can know sea and sky are alike in color, and even call
them "blue"...When he looks at sea or sky he forms the belief that what he
is looking at has the color which he has been taught to call "blue". Yet the
imiatation man does not see sea or sky as *blue*. He is not able to enjoy
their color, for they do not appear as colored to him. Similarly, he can
tell when his finger is burned or crushed, and have a powerful drive to
eliminate the condition by which he knows this. Yet he cannot suffer.

> The causal doctrine covers well the description of mentality by one
observing and explaining his fellow men. But the theory leaves out, to
put it briefly, what waking life is like to him who is living it.
-- Keith Campbell

In his paper "A Critique of Central-State Materialism", Keith Campbell
unambiguously proclaims his belief in what he calls a new epiphenomenalism
or, equivalently, Central-State Materialism Plus.  That is to say, while
observable behavior in humans must be caused by strictly physical properties
of certain mental states (which must be physical in nature), he postulates
the existence of certain phenomenal properties of these mental states that
constitute the way they *seem to us as we are experiencing them.* These
properties are non-physical, which means they cannot be described in
physical terms. Knowing everything physical there is to know about mental
states in general would *not* tell you what it is like to actually *see*
red, or *feel* pain, or *taste* a lemon. One knows what it is like to feel
pain through what Campbell calls an "imperfect apprehension" (Campbell 336)
of the non-physical, phenomenal property that goes with the mental state of
being in pain. These phenomenal properties are also known as *qualia* in the
literature. They are the characteristic and subjective way that the universe
seems to be to those who perceive it. In fact, it could be said that many,
if not most, modern objections to physicalism boil down to some kind of
argument involving qualia, or the belief that science, as we know it today,
cannot explain the subjective first person perspective. Any serious defense
of physicalism must meet these objections. As a small step in this
direction, I will attempt to show that the arguments presented in Campbell's
Critique suffer from a form of "begging the question" and an incorrect but
extremely common misunderstanding of familiar terms such as "feel" and
"experience."

Central-State Materialism, according to Campbell, is the theory that
"descriptions of mental events, states, and processes are descriptions of
inner conditions insofar as they are, directly or indirectly, causally
efficacious in the behavior of an organism" (Campbell 332). That is to say,
the mind has an "inner" existence as something physical in the organism and
is the cause of observable behavior in that organism. It is this central
role of mind as the *cause* of human behavior that leads Campbell to dub the
theory the "Causal Theory of Mind" throughout his paper. In his explanation,
he gives us a useful example of the type of analysis that central-state
materialists are wont to do :

> "I am aware that my finger has been burned" is analyzed as
"As a result of having been burned on the finger, I have entered
a new inner state apt to produce behavior wherein I discriminate the
burned finger from others which are not burned." In the
discriminating behavior I not only favor the correct finger, I favor
it in the burn-soothing way. That is, I give verbal and active
expression to the belief that my finger has been burned (Campbell 333)

Campbell is critical of this analysis, and believes it leaves something
essential out of its explanations. To illustrate his point, he asks us to
imagine a creature that distinguished different sensations on the basis of
throb frequencies. Fast throbs could mean a burning pain, slow throbs could
mean a sour taste, and so on. This creature would still be aware of
different sensations, he would still be able to tell when his finger is
burned or not burned, but he wouldn't *really* be in pain (assuming, in this
case, that throbs are not painful) and "the entire episode would not be one
which hurt in the slightest" (Campbell 333). This creature, when it burns
its finger, doesn't feel pain, but has mental states that are comparable to
those of a man who, when *he* burns *his* finger, *does* feel pain. Hence,
central-state materialism leaves something out of the analysis.

Campbell's argument certainly seems convincing on the face of it, but its
flaws become evident when one invokes the concept of
functionalism. According to "Functionalism, Qualia, and Intentionality" by
the Churchlands, functionalism is "the thesis that the essence of our
psychological states resides in the abstract causal roles they play in a
complex economy of internal states mediating environmental inputs and
behavioral outputs" (Churchland 349). In other words, understanding the
mental state of pain means getting a handle on its causal role. So what does
pain *do* for creatures who have the capacity to detect it? What is pain,
functionally defined? At least one aspect of pain seems to be glaringly
missing from Campbell's analysis, namely the aspect of
*unpleasantness*. Pain, almost by definition, is a sensation that creatures
wish to be rid of. To put it in terms of central-state analysis, the
sensation of pain causes a mental state corresponding to the awareness of
that pain, which begets *another* mental state corresponding to the desire
that the awareness should cease at once. To look at it another way, part of
what it *means* to be in pain, is to have a desire that the state of being
in pain should go away. Under this analysis, so long as the proper causal
chain is in place, from the awareness of pain to the desire that the
awareness should cease, the above creature, when he senses a burning finger
via his throbs, is in as much pain as anyone.

Although effective, this is not, perhaps, a very original
argument. In fact, Campbell anticipates it later in his paper:

> Pains are unpleasant. We prefer not to have them. We often think that we
prefer not to have them *because* they are hurtful. But perhaps this is a
mistake. Perhaps their hurtfulness is precisely that we desire to be rid of
them (Campbell 334).

In response, he asks us to imagine two people (let us call them Jack and
Jill, though Campbell does not) for whom "crushing pains" and "burning
pains" are switched but who are otherwise behaviorally identical. Both these
people exclaim "Ouch! I burned my finger!" when their fingers touch
something hot, and they both exclaim "Ouch! My finger has been crushed!"
when their finger gets trapped under something heavy. Furthermore, whether
their fingers are being crushed or burned, both people enter a state of
pain; that is, they both become aware that their fingers are being crushed
or burned and they both gain an intense desire to make that awareness cease
as soon as possible. The difference is that when Jack burns his finger, he
feels as Jill would feel when her fingers are being crushed, and vice
versa. The two people would be functionally equivalent, in the sense that
their pains perform identical functions, but their *qualia*, the
subjective nature of their pain, would differ (would, in fact, be
inverted). Hence functionalism (and physicalism as well, inasmuch as
functionalism is a form of physicalism) leaves something out.

At the risk of sidestepping the real issue, it can be argued that
physicalism, cleverly disguised as functionalism, *does* admit the
possibility, perhaps even the likelihood, of inverted or shuffled mental
state *implementations* (note that I did not use the term "qualia".)
Functionalism has never denied that a particular mental state could be
instantiated in vastly different ways for different people. This is, in
fact, the *main idea* behind functionalism. Mental states should be defined
functionally, in terms of what they do, instead of physically, in terms of
what they are made of. In the above example, Jack's sensation of burning
pain simply has a different physical structure than Jill's sensation of
burning pain. This position is outlined very plausibly, for instance, in the
Churchland essay "Functionalism, Qualia and Intentionality":

> Given the physiological and chemical variety we find in the nervous
systems of the many animals that feel pain, it appears very unlikely
that their pain states have a common physical nature underlying their
common functional nature (Churchland 351).

This discussion, of course, sidesteps the issue that Campbell was *really*
trying to get at, namely that the subjective character of each person's
burning pain sensation was different for both, and that functionalism
overlooked this important fact. I suspect that Campbell would be the first
to acknowledge the possibility that different subjective experiences of
burning one's finger could, in fact, be tied to the different ways in which
the physical pain response is set up in individual people. But explaining
how those physical pain responses lead to the subjective experiencing of
pain is something the Churchland essay glosses over. In fact, the
Churchlands seem, at times, to *support* Campbell's view that there really
is an intrinsic way that *things seem to be* to a conscious being.  In their
discussion on the "opaque discrimination" of a 60 Hz spiking frequency in
neural pathways, for example, they say the following:

> The spiking frequency of the impulse in a certain neural pathway need
not prompt the non- inferential belief, "My pain has a spiking
frequency of 60Hz"; it may prompt only the belief, "My pain
has a searing quality." But withal, the property you opaquely
distinguish as "searingness" may be precisely the property
of having 60Hz as a spiking frequency (Churchland 354).

It seems that the Churchlands are, in fact, capitulating to Campbell's
contention that non-physical phenomenal properties, the property of the *way
things seem to us*, have a real existence. Is functionalism and physicalism,
therefore, necessarily false?

The answer is no. The problem is that Campbell, and even the Churchlands,
show a misunderstanding of what it means to "feel" a burning finger. A
burning pain in Jack's finger does indeed feel painful and burning, but not
because the sensation possesses some intrinsic, non-physical, "burning"
phenomenal property that we, as humans, intuit. Rather, it feels painful
because, as argued before, the awareness of the sensation sets up a desire
that the awareness should cease, and, more to the point, it feels *burning*
because it is the sensation Jack has learned to pick out and associate with
the act of putting his finger on something hot. Most importantly, Jack's
pain will always feel as burning as ever, even though it may have a physical
basis identical to Jill's crushing pain mechanism, precisely because it is
the sensation he has learned, from birth, to associate with putting his
finger on a flame or stove. The same argument goes for Jill, and *her*
burning pain. Her burning pain may be implemented with the physiology that
implements the crushing pain in Jack, but that is completely
irrelevant. *She* has learned to associate the sensation *she* feels with
the act of putting *her* finger on something hot. To say this another way,
Jack's burning pain feels *exactly* as burning as Jill's burning pain,
though they are implemented in opposite fashions. The functionalist analysis
has left nothing out.

It may help to make the example more complicated. Imagine that when
Jack puts his finger on something hot, the sensation not only sets up
a state of mind where he is aware of the burning sensation and where
he wants it to stop, but it also sets up a whole cascade of effects
that do justice to the true complexity of a human being. Putting his
finger on a flame subconsciously reminds Jack of the time he burned
his finger when he was six and his mother took him to the doctor, of
the time when he was just a baby and his father screamed at him for
crawling to close to the stove, and of the hundreds of other times
that he has put his finger onto something hot. Far from becoming aware
of some mystical phenomenal property of the pain state, Jack merely,
according to Dennet, enters into "various discriminative states,
underlying a host of innate dispositions and learned habits of varying
complexity" (Dennet 143). This is the experience of pain that
Jack goes through.

Suppose that Jack undergoes surgery to switch his burning pain
detection physiology with his crushing pain detection physiology. Such
a maneuver is possible, at least in principle. Jack now feels as if
his finger is being crushed every time he burns it and,
unsurprisingly, it still hurts. We can still perform a causal analysis
of the painful burning sensation, as we did before. An
epiphenomenalist, like Campbell, might suppose that this causal
analysis might miss the difference between Jack's pre-operation pain
and Jack's post-operation pain (one is burning, the other
crushing). Is this really the case? Is the functional analysis of
Jack's burning pain the same in both cases? No, it isn't. The
previously mentioned cascade of effects will be completely
different. Whenever Jack now burns his finger he will no longer
subconsciously remember the time when his father yelled at him for
crawling too close to the stove but, instead, he will remember the
time, when he was eight, that his sister closed the car door on his
hand. Notice that the concept of qualia doesn't enter into the picture
at all, and yet functionalism (with a physicalist underpinning) is
still able to detect the difference between the crushing pains and the
burning pains.

Suppose, furthermore, that Jack underwent another operation to change all
his *memories* of which sensation constituted a burning pain and which
sensation constituted a crushing pain. After such an operation, Jack would
act and feel exactly the same as he did all his life. Is he still sensing
crushing pains when he is supposed to be sensing burning pains? Absolutely
not. His burning pain is precisely as burning as it was before the first
operation, even though it is now implemented with crushing pain
physiology. He would not detect any difference at all. The functionalist
analysis would say that post-operation Jack is functionally equivalent to
pre-operation Jack.  It might be tempting to point out that Jack now somehow
experiences his burning pains *differently* than how he did before, and that
the functionalist analysis leaves that fact out. Looked at from a certain
angle, this statement is partially true. By its nature, functionalism is
fairly indifferent to physiological considerations.  A *physicalist*
analysis, however, *would* root out the difference. What is *not* true is
the notion that Jack now experiences a different kind of burning pain than
he did before. Jack would remember the pain feeling exactly as it always
felt. Note again that, in this entire discussion, the concept of qualia was
never brought up. If anything, the above discussion provides some evidence
that phenomenal properties aren't real properties after all. Using
traditional language, the mental state of Jack's that used to posses a
phenomenal property of crushing pain now possesses a phenomenal property of
burning pain. So what happened?  Where did the "crushing pain" go? Where did
the "burning pain" come from? These are tough questions to answer if one
accepts the existence of qualia in the literal sense.

Dennet, in his paper "Instead of Qualia", insists that the above type of
analysis is enough to explain everything there is to know about human
experience usually attributed to qualia, and the illusion of why indeed it
*seems* as if mental states have some sort of non-physical, inexpressible
properties to which we alone are privy. In his own words:

> The dispositional properties of those discriminative states already
suffice to explain *all* the effects: the effects on both peripheral
behavior (saying "Red!", stepping the brake, etc.) and "internal" behavior
(judging "Red!", seeing something as red, reacting with uneasiness or
displeasure if, say, red things upset one) (Dennet 143).

In other words, we don't *need* qualia to explain the "experience" of
burning pain, whether it's the external behavior of saying "Ouch!" or the
internal behavior of knowing you're in pain. This, of course, does not
*prove* that phenomenal properties don't exist, but it does show that
postulating their existence is a superfluous step. By the principle of
Occum's Razor which says, essentially, that one should not make things more
complicated then they need to be, the concept of phenomenal properties
become useless.

The above analysis settles the issue of "inverted qualia", or "juggled
phenomenal properties". Simply put, there are no phenomenal properties, as
Campbell uses the term. As it happens, the above discussion also produces a
convenient way to fight the notion of "absent qualia", as embodied in
Campbell's story of the imitation man.  Such a creature is behaviorally
indistinguishable from what can presumably be called a genuine man, but his
mental states do not posses any so-called phenomenal properties. That is to
say, such a creature does not truly feel the hurtfulness of pain (even
though he may say "Ouch!"  when his finger is burned), and does not truly
taste the sourness of lemon (even though he may pucker his lips when a piece
of the fruit is placed in his mouth). The imitation man can tell the
difference between different sensations but the beliefs "just pop into his
head" (Campbell 333). He does not *experience* the phenomenal properties
associated with them.

Campbell intended his imitation man to be a form of *modal argument*. In
other words, he thought that such a being was *logically possible*, that it
was possible to conceive of two creatures completely alike in every physical
respect, except that the mental states of one possessed phenomenal
properties which were "imperfectly apprehended" by the creature doing the
experiencing, while the mental states of the other had no phenomenal
properties at all. Since such a creature is logically possible, so the
argument goes, then physicalism *has* to leave something out. One very easy
way to dismiss this claim is by simply denying the existence of phenomenal
properties in the first place.  The imitation man is a logical possibility
only if one *already* believes in the existence of phenomenal
properties. The imitation man argument, therefore, suffers from fallacious
reasoning. It begs the question. As discussed before, it is entirely
possible to explain everything there is to explain about external and
internal human behaviors by the dispositional properties of discriminative
states, as explained by Dennet.

If one does not believe that phenomenal properties are real, then it
suddenly becomes fairly obvious that there is no difference whatsoever
between, say, an imitation Jack and a genuine Jack.  Insofar as they are
physically identical, they are one in the same.  This can be further
illustrated by thinking, once again, of a burning sensation. Suppose that
genuine Jack burns his finger (again). How does Jack *know* that he has
burned his finger? How does he *know* that it is painful in consequence? The
answer, quite simply, is that he "just does". To put it in terms of the
causal theory of mind, the hot object causes Jack's mind to enter into a
mental state corresponding to the awareness that his finger has been burned,
which in turns causes a whole host of other physical effects. If one does
not believe in phenomenal properties, the story pretty much ends there. More
to the point, imitation Jack learns about his burns is precisely the same
way. As Campbell points out: "[The imitation man] spontaneously gains a new
belief, it just 'pops into his head' that he has burned his finger or broken
his toe, as the case may be" (Campbell 333). If one were to try and argue
that imitation Jack wouldn't have the same *experience* of finger burning as
genuine Jack, then I have to ask what is meant by the term "experience".
When genuine Jack burns his finger, he is reminded of the time his father
screamed at him for crawling to close to the stove. Imitation Jack is
reminded of exactly the same thing. Genuine Jack yelps "Ouch!" and sucks his
finger, and so does imitation Jack.  Remembering that there are no such
thing as phenomenal properties, what part of the episode is genuine Jack
experiencing, that imitation Jack is not? The answer, of course, is no
part. If imitation Jack were not going through the same mental states as
genuine Jack, then he wouldn't be a very good imitation. That is to say,
imitation Jack would be functionally different from genuine Jack, and hence
they would be acting differently for functionalist or physicalist reasons.

In conclusion, the arguments presented by Campbell, although
convincing on the face, do not show that central-state materialism in
its current form is incomplete. It is possible to explain all the
effects that human beings experience when they perceive red or feel
pain or taste lemon, including the internal judgments they express,
simply by appealing to physical effects and physical
causes. Specifically, the ideas of inverted phenomenal properties
(told through the story of Jack and Jill) and absent phenomenal
properties (told through the story of the imitation man) only work if
you assume the existence of phenomenal properties in the first
place. As I showed, however, neither qualia or phenomenal properties
are necessary in the explanation of human experience, though, of
course, one cannot prove with absolute certainty that they don't
exist. By the principle of Occum's Razor, we should throw them out of
our explanations entirely, or at least realize that when we talk of
them, we do not mean literal, real, properties of mental states that
are, on principal, irreducible to physics, but rather the set of
internal dispositional states that external stimulus are apt to
produce in humans.
