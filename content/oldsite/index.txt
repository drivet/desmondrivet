title: A Trip Down Memory Lane
---

I've had some form of web presence since about 1998 or so, when I made my
first hand coded website available online.  Or maybe I used Netscape
Composer. Honestly, I can't remember.  Over the years, the various
incarnations of my website have been hosted on, in no particular order,
[U of T][1] servers, [PCI Geomatics][2] servers, [Geocities][3],
[Netfirms][4], and a series of home machines set aside for this express
purpose.

When I finally started my blog in earnest, I basically pushed aside all the
old content in favour of the new.  The stuff I had written up until that
point was largely forgotten, and started gathering dust on my old Sun Ultra
10, which was the last machine to host my site before I finally gave in and
started using a web hosting company (then a VPS and then, finally, a
dedicated server which I rent from [kimsufi][5])

I've recently dug out my Sun Ultra 10 from my closet and have since been
knee-deep in nostalgia.  I think my old site, or, at least, selected parts
of it, deserves a home, and this page will act as such - your gateway to the
past!  Expect new (well, actually, *old*) things to show up here as I work
my way through the years.

The content, for the most part, remains unchanged, with a few exceptions
(like converting the HTML to markdown and fixing broken links where
possible).  Enjoy!
