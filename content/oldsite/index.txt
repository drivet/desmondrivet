title: A Trip Down Memory Lane
---

I've had a web presence in some form or another since about 1998 or so, when
I made my first hand coded HTML pages available online.  Or maybe I used
Netscape Composer; honestly, I can't remember.  Over the years, the various
incarnations of my website have been hosted on, in no particular order,
[U of T][1] servers, [PCI Geomatics][2] servers, [Geocities][3],
[Netfirms][4], and a series of home machines set aside for this express
purpose.

When I finally started my blog in earnest, I basically pushed aside all the
old content in favour of the new.  The stuff I had written up until that
point was largely forgotten, and started gathering dust on my old Sun Ultra
10, which was the last machine to host my site before I finally gave in and
started using a web hosting company (then a VPS and then, finally, a
dedicated server which I rent from [kimsufi][5])

I've recently dug out my Sun Ultra 10 from my closet and have since been
knee-deep in nostalgia.  I think my old site or, at least, selected parts of
it, deserves a home, and this page will act as such - your gateway to the
past!  Expect new (well, actually, *old*) things to show up here as I work
my way through the years.

The content, for the most part, remains unchanged, with a few exceptions
(like converting the HTML to markdown and fixing broken links where
possible).  Enjoy! Or not...

## Personal Stuff

* [PEY - The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](pey.html)
* [Desmond's Trip to France](france.html). I had a lot of vacation time
  coming to me, so I took three weeks off work and decided to visit France
  in the fall of 2003.

## Projects

* [The Graphics Pipeline](gp.html).  A graphics library I wrote.
* [Animats and Active Vision Systems](thesis.html).  My undergrad thesis.


## Various Essays

* [In Defense of Emacs](emacsdefense.html).  I use emacs.  I sometimes feel the need to defend this.
* [The Computer as a Tool](msdefense.html).  An apology for Microsoft.  I was young once.
* [Why I'll Never Torture Cats](freewill.html). My version of free
  will. Developed from a talk I had with my friends Scott and Philip.
* [Metal Souls and Mental Darwinism](ai.html). I wrote this one about 6
  years ago. It was my first attempt to put into words my beliefs about the
  validity of A.I. I think I was on the wrong track with this essay, but it
  remains here for reference.
* [The Moral Basis for the Right to Health Care](bioessay.html).  I went
  through a libertarian phase in my youth.  Take this essay with a grain of
  salt.
* [The Nature of Omnipotence](god.html). My first attempt at explaining why
  I'm an atheist.
* [Defending Physicalism](essaymind.html). This one was written for my
  fourth year philosophy of mind course. I think it's a persuasive essay.
* [When A Red Ball Is Not A Red Ball](logic.html). My as-yet unfinished
  follow up to <a href="essays/god.html">The Nature of
  Omnipotence</a>. Unpolished but the outline is clear. Heavily influenced
  by the philosophy of mind course I took in my 4th year at U of T
