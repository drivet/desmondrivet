title: The Nature of Omnipotence

> Let us break the chains of the prejudice called Logic.  Are we going to be
stopped by a syllogism? -- Dr. Floyd Ferris, from Ayn Rand's novel
<cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>

I just joined alt.atheism. It's an interesting newsgroup that goes through
several hundred posts a day. Although it's mostly populated by hardcore
theists and atheists (at least, these are the most vocal members) the group
is also home to a significant number of avowed agnostics. For those of you
who are not familiar with the terms, a *theist* is a person who follows
theism, or the belief in the existence of a personal and perhaps friendly
God. Most of the more popular religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam) are
theist in nature.  An *atheist*, on the other hand, is a follower of
atheism, or the belief that God does not and has never existed. An
*agnostic*, or a follower of agnosticism, is a bit more subtle. According to
the Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, agnosticism is

>the doctrine that the existence of a personal Deity, an unseen
   world, etc., can be neither proved nor disproved, because of the
   necessary limits of the human mind (as sometimes charged upon
   Hamilton and Mansel), or because of the insufficiency of the
   evidence furnished by physical and physical data, to warrant a
   positive conclusion (as taught by the school of Herbert Spencer)

This definition, of course, entirely glosses over the issue of who
exactly this Deity (or God) person is supposed to be. Webster's
Dictionary says that God is:

> A being conceived of as possessing supernatural power, and to be
propitiated by sacrifice, worship, etc.; a divinity; a deity; an
object of worship; an idol.

Many religious people will sometimes augment this definition by recognizing
in God the attribute of omnipotence. Just to be sure that there are no
misunderstandings, the supernatural is simply defined as that which is above
or beyond the established laws of the universe while omnipotence is defined
as the ability to do anything - literally *anything*.

Why am I bothering with all this formalism? I'm bothering with it because,
although I realize that many people believe in such a supernatural,
omnipotent entity, I don't think these same people give enough thought to
what exactly this sort of omnipotence would entail. There's a popular
paradox that's passed around in philosophical circles : "Can God create a
stone so heavy that He cannot lift it?" If you believe in the existence of a
truly omnipotent God, then the answer to that question is a simple
*yes*. God is supposed to be beyond logical contradictions because He, of
course, *invented* logic.  He must be able to posses the quality of
omnipotence *and* be able to create a stone that he cannot lift. He must be
able to create a square shaped circle and a red coloured blue. He must be
able to know every corner of the universe *and* the have the ability to get
lost in it, at the same time. He must be able to turn a dog into a castle at
the same time that the dog is busy being a dog.

This God must have the ability to break the most basic, fundamental laws of
nature, existence and logic.  This God must be able to break the law of
identity (the law that says that a rock is a rock or, more formally, that A
is A) and break the law of non-contradiction (the law that says that a rock
can't be a cat while it is busy being a rock) To be blunt, this God must
have the ability to *exist* and *not exist*, at the same time - *and* this
God must have the ability to *not* have this ability, at the same time. At
this point, I seem to be reduced to gibberish. It's not really
surprising. When the law of non-contradiction goes out the window, anything
is possible - **anything**.

Some people will try to circumvent the obvious problems involved here by
narrowing the definition of omnipotence. *Of course* God can't change the
laws of logic, the argument goes; he's merely a very powerful entity who can
bend matter and energy (as opposed to the fabric of reality itself) to his
will, who created humanity and all the suns and planets, and who set out all
the laws of physics in one big tapestry for reasons as yet unknown to us.
What these people are describing is a *natural* God (as opposed to a
*supernatural* God) - essentially nothing more than a very, very powerful
alien. I don't buy the argument. I suppose such a critter could exist, but
since we are now talking about a natural entity, the concept of evidence
suddenly becomes applicable, and there is no evidence for such a being that
can't be explained by less extreme theories. Besides, God is supposed to be
supernatural; anything less and we can't really call such a creature God,
now can we? At least, not according to Webster's.

Almost by definition, I don't believe the human mind can grasp the
existence of a truly omnipotent entity, who can break the rules of
logic, and I suspect that anyone who says otherwise is either lying or
naive.  Some people will now, I'm sure, try to label me as an
agnostic. I think that label is a bit inaccurate since, contrary to
some who say that one cannot "prove" the existence or non-existence of
God one way or the other, I think it is actually very, very, very easy
to "prove" that God does not exist, if you accept the validity of the
law of non-contradiction. If you accept it, then an entity capable of
making contradictions possible is automatically excluded from the
realm of existence, from the get-go. Hence, God does not exist. End of
story. Convincing, eh?

The standard rebuttal at this point, promulgated by both theists and
agnostics alike, is usually along the lines of "Can you prove that the law
of non-contradiction or that the law of identity is valid? No?  Then your
argument falls apart." The theists will go on to say that God is "beyond
logic" (or something similar), and the agnostics will go on to say that the
existence of God is still an unprovable issue.  The first part of the
rebuttal, I admit, is partly true; I can't "prove" that logic, as a science
or a method, is valid, but that's only because the laws of logic (the law of
non-contradiction and its ilk) are the basis upon which any kind "proof" is
built, and hence are not subject to proof. While we're on the topic, I
should probably also mention that I can't bite my teeth either. What these
people are looking for is a way to prove the validity of the law of
non-contradiction *without invoking it* i.e. by strictly *illogical*
means. I'll be happy to oblige them; I will simply assert that the law of
non-contradiction is one hundred percent proven and meet every objection
with nothing more than a cry of "You're wrong, sucker!"  followed by an
exclamation of "Urp!". The "Urp!" is very important; without it, my
illogical proof doesn't work.

What are they going to do? Say I'm wrong? By what means will they
attempt to show it?

Of course, this is probably not what these people mean by an "illogical"
proof.  But if it isn't, and one still does not accept the validity of the
law of non-contradiction as the irrefutable basis of any proof, then I'd
really, *really* like to know what exactly is meant by the terms "proof" and
"prove"...

As for the second claim, that my argument falls apart, I suppose that
depends on how you look at it. Let me just say that when agnostics throw
doubt on the power of logic, when they state that the laws of logic are not
the basis of proof, but are subject to proof just like everything else, when
they assert that for a theory to qualify as truly "ironclad" one has to
"prove" the validity of it's basic logic through means that don't involve
logic...then they undercut and undermine the sum total of all human
knowledge. With this in mind, will they still say that the existence of God
is an unprovable issue?

Some people try to resolve the issue by asserting the existence of
a different kind of "logic", one that is not based on the law of
non-contradiction. I suppose the problem I have with that assertion is
one of semantics. I realize we're just arguing over labels, but I
don't think I'm alone when I say that, for me, the word "logic" is
indelibly tied to the law of non-contradiction and that using the word
to describe something radically different is horribly misleading. I
could just as easily say that a circle is really just a different kind
of square, but is that a truly useful statement? If one insists on
using the word "logic" to describe something that is essentially the
opposite of what people normally think of logic, then I will simply
say that one is describing a very, very, very, very, very, different
kind of logic indeed - so different that one is better off using a
different label to describe it.

So that's the end of that. I have to come to the conclusion that God does
not exist. I *know* that God cannot exist, in *exactly* the same way that I
*know* that water cannot be a rock at the same time that it is busy being
water. I'm an atheist, not an agnostic.  Furthermore, I suspect that many
agnostics are actually atheists who have just never thought about the full
implications of their position, or just want to keep their bases covered in
case there really *is* a hell. To paraphrase Carl Sagan, I think many
agnostics are just atheists without the courage of their convictions.

Most religious people, will usually assert at this point that logic isn't
everything and that some things in life just require faith. I won't argue
with them ( I *can't* argue with them ), any more than I can say anything
useful when I'm confronted by people who claim that the Bible is the Word of
God because *God said it was so*.  I hold no ill will; at least these people
realize that they have no logical leg to stand on (I say this with no value
judgment at all). Some of them will undoubtedly find solace in their
beliefs. Whatever makes them happy, I say, so long as they don't try to
force others to believe the same thing. The key thing to realize is that the
belief is illogical, and leave it at that. The rest follows from there.
