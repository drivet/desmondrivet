Hello, and welcome!  You've reached the personal domain of Desmond Rivet.  I
hope you enjoy your stay.

## About Me

I currently reside in Montreal, Canada where I work for [Unity
Technologies][10] as a full-stack developer.

Apart from programming, I also enjoy writing, reading, cooking and mixing
drinks (you can blame [Mad Men][11] for that last one).

Recently I've discovered the [Indie Web][12] and though I am currently
obsessed with its ideas, it also makes me feel incredibly old to think that
blogs and personal websites are things that need to be repopularized.

## About This Site

This site is home to a fair amount of content and, accordingly, a fair
amount of thought has gone into its [design and layout][14].  Among other
things, this site sports:

* a bunch of [notes][13], i.e. short, titleless posts that other people
  might call "tweets"
* a [blog][1], where I publish longer thoughts on a semi-regular basis
* a [piwigo][2] [photo album][3]
* a [wiki][4], which I use to keep track of longer term pages like recipes
* various [selected pages][5] from my old sites
