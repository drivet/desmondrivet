You've reached the personal domain of Desmond Rivet, a full-stack software
developer living in Montreal, Canada.  Welcome!

I've maintained some form of personal website since roughly 1998 or so, when
I made my first hand coded HTML pages available online.  There've been a few
over the years, hosted on variously on [U of T][8] servers, [Geocities][7],
[Netfirms][9] and a raft of dedicated home machines.

The current incarnation has been hosted for several years on a server rented
from [kimsufi][6].  I'm going to try and make this one last.

Though I was born in Montreal, and currently reside there, I spent a lot of
my formative years in Toronto.  I have a Bachelor's degree in Engineering
from the Univerity of Toronto's Engineering Science program.

I guess my main hobby would be programming, but I also enjoy writing,
reading and cooking.  Oh, and mixing drinks.  You can blame Mad Men for
that.

At the moment, this site is home to:

* a [blog][1], where I publish random thoughts on a semi-regular basis
* a [piwigo][2] [photo album][3]
* a [wiki][4], which I use to keep track of longer term pages like recipes
* various [selected pages][5] from my old sites

Please make yourself at home!
