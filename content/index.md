title: Welcome to the Low Rent District

Hi everyone. You've reached the personal domain of Desmond Rivet.  There
have been a few over the years but I'm going to try and make this one last.

<div class="question" markdown="1">
### <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span> Who are you?

I'm a software developer living in Montreal, Quebec.  I've written up some
[personal information][1] if you're interested.

<div class="question" markdown="1">
### <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span> Why "The Low Rent District"?

This site is called "The Low Rent District" because:

 * I live in Saint-Henri, a neigbourhood of Montreal which is generally
   considered to be low-rent.
 * When it comes to technology, I tend to be cheap.

<div class="question" markdown="1">
### <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span> What kind of stuff do you have on here?

At the moment this domain is home to a [blog][3], [photos][6] and a
[wiki][2].  I've also written up some [site design notes][4] if you're
interested.

Before I started maintaining a blog, I used to just write random, ad-hoc
essays and pages.  I've [indexed most of these][5] elsewhere on my site.
