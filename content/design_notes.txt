Title: Design Notes

At the moment this site is mostly an experiment in python programming.  The
pages and the blog are all delivered via a home-grown blogging system/CMS
that I've called YAWT (Yet Another Weblog Tool), written in python.

I've made the HTML as simple and as standards compliant as I can.  For the
most part, the stuff on this site should look okay in older and text based
browsers.
