Title: About Me

There's not much to tell. My name is Desmond Rivet. I'm a software
developer. I live in Montreal, Canada.

The whole story, of course, is slightly more complicated than that.  I was
born in Montreal, then moved to Toronto when I was 12.  I'm a graduate of
the [Engineering Science][1] program at the [University of Toronto][2] (I
chose the Computer option at the time, but it appears that they have now
[merged][3] with the Electrical option).

After graduating from the University of Toronto, I started work as a
software developer at a telecom company that eventually ended up moving me
back to Montreal. I worked there for about 7 years until I decided that I
needed a change of pace and, as of 2007, I'm a happy employee at [Intelerad
Medical Systems][4].  I live with my girlfriend in an old, large apartment.

I enjoy programming, writing, TV, movies, books, drinking and cooking.  You
can find a few of my experiments and recipes on my
