Title: About Me

There's not much to tell.

My name is Desmond Rivet.  I'm a software developer currently living in
Montreal, Canada.

The whole story, of course, is slightly more complicated than that.  I was
born in Montreal, then moved to Toronto when I was 12.  I'm a graduate of
the [Engineering Science](http://www.engsci.utoronto.ca/) program at the
[University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/) (I chose the Computer
option at the time, but it appears that they have now
[merged](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/ece.htm) with
the Electrical option).

After graduating from the University of Toronto, I started work as a
software developer at a telecom company that eventually ended up moving me
back to Montreal. I worked there for about 7 years until I decided that I
needed a change of pace and, as of 2007, I'm a happy employee at [Intelerad
Medical Systems](http://www.intelerad.com/en/).  I live with my girlfriend
in an old, large apartment.

I enjoy writing, programming, TV, movies, drinking and cooking.  You can
find a few of my experiments and recipes on my
