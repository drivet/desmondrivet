There's not much to tell. My name is Desmond Rivet. That's me to the
left. I'm a software developer. I live in Montreal, Canada.

The whole story, of course, is slightly more complicated than that.  I was
born in Montreal, then moved to Toronto when I was 12.  I'm a graduate of
the [Engineering Science][1] program at the [University of Toronto][2] (I
chose the Computer option at the time, but it appears that they have now
[merged][3] with the Electrical option).

After graduating from the University of Toronto, I started work as a
software developer at a telecom company that eventually ended up moving me
back to Montreal.  I worked there for about 7 years until I decided that I
needed a change of pace and, as of 2007, I'm a happy employee at [Intelerad
Medical Systems][4].  

In 2010, my girlfriend and I moved into a large, hundred year old Edwardian
apartment.  It's been...an experience :-) We both like the space and the
neigbourhood, but I will say the place has ended being alot more work than
thought it would be.  At some point I need to put up some pictures.

I guess my main hobby would be programming, but I also enjoy writing,
reading and cooking.  Oh, and mixing drinks.  You can blame Mad Men for
that.  You can find a few of my experiments and recipes on my [wiki][5] and
[blog][6].
