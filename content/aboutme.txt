Title: About Me

My name is Desmond Rivet.  I'm a software developer currently living in
Montreal, Canada.

The whole story, of course, is slightly more complicated than that.  I was
born in Montreal, then moved to Toronto when I was 12.  After graduating from
the University of Toronto, I moved back to Montreal when the job moved
here.

That job is now history and as of 2007, I'm a happy employee at Intelerad
Medical Systems.

My likes include: books, movies, TV, cooking, programming.
