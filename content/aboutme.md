title: The Story So Far...

There's not much to tell. My name is Desmond Rivet. I'm a software
developer. I live in Montreal, Canada.

The whole story is, of course, more complicated than that.  I was born in
Montreal, then moved to Toronto when I was 12, where I went to high school
and University and basically spent a lot of my formative years.  I graduated
from the [Engineering Science][1] program at the [University of Toronto][2]
(I chose the Computer option at the time, but it appears that they have now
[merged][3] with the Electrical option).

After graduating from the University of Toronto, I started work as a
software developer at a telecom company that eventually ended up moving me
back to Montreal.  The adjustment wasn't too bad, but I do get irritated
when people simply assume I'm a Torontonian by birth.  I can only conclude
that this is because:

 * I am an Anglophone
 * I don't denigrate Toronto every single chance I get
 * I am perhaps more willing than many Montrealers to recognize this city's flaws

Anyway, I worked at this telecom company, in Montreal, for about 6 years
until I decided that I needed a change of pace and, as of 2007, I'm a happy
software developer at [Intelerad Medical Systems][4].

In 2010, my girlfriend and I moved into a large, ornate, hundred year old
Edwardian apartment (and I'll say right here that this is one of Montreal's
strengths - more or less affordable housing).  It's been...an experience.
We both like the space and the neigbourhood, but I will say the place has
ended being a lot more work than thought it would be.  At some point I need
to put up some pictures.

I guess my main hobby would be programming, but I also enjoy writing,
reading and cooking.  Oh, and mixing drinks.  You can blame Mad Men for
that.  You can find a few of my experiments and recipes on my [wiki][5] and
[blog][6].
