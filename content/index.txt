Title: Welcome

Hi everyone. You've reached the personal domain of Desmond Rivet.  There
have been a few over the years but I'm going to try and make this one last.

At the moment this domain is home to a <a
href="http://wiki.desmondrivet.net">wiki</a>, mostly for notes, and a <a
href="blog/">blog</a>, mostly for whatever musings du jour I feel the need
to get off my chest. Feel free to peruse them both.  I've also written up
some [personal information](aboutme.html) and [site design
notes](design_notes.html) if you're interested.

Certain sections of this domain are secured. If you wish to access them, you
have two options:

 * Live with the warning your browser gives you
 * Download and install my [personal root certificate](/static/desmond_rivet_intl_ca.crt)
