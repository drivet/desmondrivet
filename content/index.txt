Title: Welcome

Hi everyone. You've reached the personal domain of Desmond Rivet.  There
have been a few over the years but I'm going to try and make this one last.


Certain sections of this domain are secured. If you wish to access them, you
have two options:

 * Live with the warning your browser gives you
 * Download and install my [personal root certificate](/static/desmond_rivet_intl_ca.crt)

## Site Design and Layout

The graphic used for the site header is a photo of the Montreal skyline,
taken from the balcony of my former apartment.

At the moment I have a <a href="http://wiki.desmondrivet.net">wiki</a> and a
<a href="blog/">blog</a> set up. Feel free to preuse those.  I
also have some [personal information](aboutme.html) if you're interested.

This site is mostly an experiment in python.  The pages and the blog are all
delivered via a home-grown blogging system/CMS that I've called YAWT (Yet
Another Weblog Tool), written in python.  It's a work in progress.  At some
point, maybe I'll write a page about it.

I've tried to make the HTML and CSS as simple and as standards compliant as
I can.  For the most part, the stuff on this site should look okay in older
and text based browsers.  At least, that's what I tell myself; honestly, I
have no sense of aesthetics :)
