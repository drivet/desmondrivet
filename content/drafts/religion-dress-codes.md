A while back I wrote a [blog entry on the proposed Charter of Quebec
values][1].  I didn't like the proposal then and I don't like it now.

Soon after I wrote that article, the PQ ended up suffering a rather decisive
defeat, and so I mentally relegated the Charter to the dustbin of history.
I didn't think I would ever end up writing another one of these articles
again.

And yet here we are.  The newly elected CAQ government is proposing a what
amounts to Charter 2.0 and is willing to apply the notwithstanding clause to
get it.  The mind reels.

Different parties have different names for this kind of legislation, and
they vary in how far they want to take it.  The CAQ's version, for example,
isn't quite as far-reaching as the PQ's.  Whereas the PQ would have banned
the conspicuous display of any kind religious paraphernalia by any
government employee, the CAQ is proposing a ban on religious symbols which
extends merely to people in positions of "authority", like judges, police
officers and teachers.  In both cases, however, the crucifix would remain in
the National Assembly.

Quebec Solidaire's proposal, on the other hand, is a straight adaptation of
the Bouchard-Taylor Commission which, notably, recommends removing the
crucifix from the National Assembly.

In any case, my thoughts on the subject are still applicable now:

* This kind of "religious neutrality charter" is almost never about
  protecting secularism.  If protecting secularism were a priority, the
  cross in the National Assembly would come down.
  
* Secularism doesn't really need any extra protection.  To my knowledge
  there have been no cases in Canada of a person in a position of authority
  acting in anything but a religiously neutral manner.

* Even if such cases did exist, it's unclear how establishing a religiously
  neutral dress code would solve the problem.  One does not need a hijab,
  turban or yarmulke to let one's religious views affect one's judgment in
  civil matters - just ask [Kim Davis][2].

* How do you even decide what counts as "religious" in this context?  People
  are apparently willing to label the crucifix in the National Assembly a
  "cultural artifact"; why can't a yarmulke count as such?  What about a
  [long, black skirt][4]?

The first point disqualifies the CAQ and PQ proposals; neither of them are
willing to take down the crucifix in the National Assembly.  But the latter
points disqualify the Quebec Solidaire's proposal as well.  Ultimately, the
issue isn't the crucifix per se (though focusing on it is an efficient way
to shake loose the bigoted hypocrites in your midst) but rather that *the
proposals are trying to solve a non-problem*.  It's hard to imagine that any
"religious neutrality charter" is anything but an attempt to pander to the
more xenophobic elements in Quebec society.  You know, the kind who think
that immigrants are trying to [erase Christmas][3].

I'm saying all this so that people have no doubts where I stand on this
issue.  It's important to be clear on this point in light of what the rest
of this article is going to discuss.

## Freedom of Expression and All That

One of the insidious things about Donald Trump is that he'll take an issue
that seems, if you squint, semi-legitimate on the face of it, and then draw
entirely the wrong conclusions.

Take, for example, the issue of illegal immigration.  Assuming that this is
a real problem in the United States (I don't have any statistics on the
subject) it is, in fact, possible to discuss the matter without implying
that Mexicans are rapists, or that children of people who try to sneak
across the border should be kept in cages and permanently separated from
their parents - but you'd never know it by listening to Trump, or his
followers.

It's possible, in other words, to support a strong border patrol *and* be
disgusted by a man like Donald Trump and everything he stands for.

That being said, I occasionally come across people who don't seem to grasp
this idea - who think, for example, that being anti-Trump means being
against the idea of any immigration rules at all.  "Open the borders!" and
all that.

I sometimes get the same vibe from people when discussing, for example,
school dress codes.  It's absolutely true that girls are often unfairly
targeted when enforcing these kinds of rules.  This is a legitimate problem
that needs to be addressed - but some people respond to that by railing
against the *very notion of dress codes in general*.

Here's the thing.  Unless you believe that speedos and bikinis are
appropriate school attire, then you support some form of dress code.  You've
bought into the concept and the rest of the debate, as the saying goes, is
just haggling over the price.

When it comes to the debate over the display of religious by civil servants,
people will often frame it as a simple matter of freedom of expression.  

And I get that, alright?  I get that. But I sometimes feel a bit taken aback
by how often the conversation devolves into a diatribe on how there
shouldn't be any standards of dress at all.
