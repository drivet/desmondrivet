The [artist][1] who draws [xkcd][2] will occasionally put out a comic
designed to make people my age feel old.  There's this one for example:

![XKCD Simpsons][3]

And this one too:

![XKCD Movie Ages][4]

They are, for the most part, successful in their stated goal - I do indeed
feel old when I read them. That being said, I don't think I've ever felt
quite as old as I felt when, last year, I discovered the [IndieWeb][5], an
online community dedicated to resuscitating the personal website.

Why does this make me feel old?  It's simple. I've maintained some sort of
personal web presence/site/blog since about 1998 or so, when I made my first
hand-coded HTML pages available online at U of T, and apparently enough time
has past not only for the concept of a "personal website" to have become
quaint and old-fashioned but *also* for it to have been re-energized by an
enthusiastic band of hobbyists with a taste for the retro and a fondness for
old-school fan pages.

You hear that?  I've moved beyond pass√© into *retro*.  It's as if I never
stopped wearing 80's clothes but now they're cool again so it's okay.

## Why Not the Status Quo?

To be honest, until I stumbled upon the IndieWeb, it had never even occurred
to me that the personal website was a thing that needed reviving but, in
retrospect, it does seem obvious that I'm a bit of an outlier.  Personal
blogs (in the sense of someone running their own blogging software on their
own domain) are not something you see much nowadays; people with something
pithy to say will use Twitter or Facebook and those with longer attention
spans will use something like Medium.  It's just easier, right?

Why would anyone want something different?  The answer could probably be
summarized in one word: control.

When you post a tweet, it's no longer yours; it becomes the property of
Twitter and they can do what they like with it.  What happens to your tweets
or status updates if Twitter or Facebook go out of business?  It seems
unlikely, but times change.

Or, perhaps more likely, what happens if you simply want to leave? Imagine
that Facebook crosses one too many lines and you decide that you're better
off without it.  What happens to your content then?

What happens if Medium decides to start charging money and you decide it's
not worth it?

I mean, sure, there are other reasons to avoid these sites.  No one likes to
see ads.  Facebook is constantly tracking your online activities and selling
what it collects to nefarious organizations.  Twitter contributes to the
echo chamber effect.

But honestly? These all take a back seat to the issue of control.  Even if
there existed a completely benign, free, adless, non-tracking social
network, the problems I described would still exist.

## Failed Attempts

There have been attempts over the years to push sites like Facebook off
their perch.  They all failed for various reasons.

One of the first and most notable ones was [Diaspora][6].  It was touted as a
kind of decentralized Facebook, where users could post status updates and
pictures, send messages, etc.  Users joined Diaspora by hosting their own
"pod", running specialized software, which would communicate with other pods
in the Diaspora network.  There was also a hosted version that you could
sign up for, but that kind of defeated the purpose of the whole endeavour.

It was an interesting experiment, but it failed miserably.  Many people
point to the fact that the initial software offering was riddled with bugs,
and that setting up your own pod was a daunting task, but in reality I think
the reason was simpler: Disapora ultimately didn't have very many users.
Imagine going to all the trouble to launch a Disapora pod only to discover
that no one you knew was on the network?

More subtly, the issue is one of interoperability.  The IndieWeb community's
blanket term for sites like Facebook and Twitter is "silos" and the metaphor
is apt.  People take it for granted that Facebook users don't get to follow
you on Twitter unless they're also Twitter users.  Sending a message to
someone on Facebook doesn't work unless that person is also a Facebook user.
You don't get to comment on Medium articles unless you create yourself a
Medium account.

Despite being decentralized and free, Diaspora is also a kind of silo.
Generally speaking, when you post something to Diaspora, the only people who
can see it are other Disapora users.  Your posts do not show up, for
example, on someone's Twitter feed.

Can you imagine if something as basic as email worked like that?  Can you
imagine if gmail users couldn't send emails to anyone other than gmail
users?  The fact that they can is directly because of the fact that the
protocols involved in sending emails are open standards.

So why can't social networking work similarly?
